We’ve all been there.

'Ugh fields', or why you can’t even bear to think about that task | Medium

1

‘Ugh Fields’ are a really useful concept. The existing explanation is written for a
niche audience, so I’ll have a go at explaining them myself:

The problem
Have you ever had a long-overdue task to do, a task which isn’t so bad in itself, but
which you can barely bring yourself to think about without feeling awful?
Most people experience this from time to time. Here’s how things get to such a
strange and dire state.
The first day the task is on your to-do list, you don’t end up starting, because the
short-term reward isn’t large enough to overcome the psychological cost of doing so.
Maybe you feel low-energy. Maybe you have more urgent priorities. Maybe you’re
insecure about whether you can do a good job. Maybe the task involves a bit of
social awkwardness. Whatever the reason — you delay.
Unfortunately, this task is one that only gets more unpleasant over time.
Maybe now you’re going to have to rush and do a bad job, and you fear everyone
will judge you negatively.
Or now that it’s late, you feel you have to do an especially great job to make up for it.
Or whenever you do send it out, the late delivery is going to embarrass you
regardless. Or perhaps you’re simply ashamed and annoyed with yourself that you
haven’t finished it already.

Either way, as time goes on, the task becomes even less appealing to work on. Even
less appealing than it was the first day, when it was already bad enough that you
didn’t do it!
So it’s now inevitable that — unless you’re rescued by a day when you feel
especially energetic, or a deadline that makes the costs of further delay intolerable
— this is a task that you’re destined to put off until you shuffle off this mortal coil.
Alright, almost everyone has experienced this horror-show of a situation.
But there’s another very important thing that happens in the meantime.
Each time you think about the task, you a) don’t start it, and b) feel a pang of
guilt/shame/fear about your ever-more-procrastinated task. Those bad feelings
usually only get worse over time, as your situation makes you feel more and more
ridiculous and ashamed.
You feel so terrible, but even that’s not enough to get you to start — what an
embarrassment of a person you are!
As a result — and this is the interesting bit — you’re constantly being negatively
reinforced for even thinking about the topic.
Gradually the thing you mentally associate with this task stops being what’s required
to complete it. Or the reward of doing so. Or the reason you took it on in the first
place.
Rather your only association becomes the flinching pain you feel whenever you
accidentally remember it.
From this, your brain gradually learns that thinking about this task is the mental
version of stubbing your toe. Just as your brain learns to avoid whacking your foot
into things, it learns to find creative ways to prevent the task you’re avoiding rising
into your conscious awareness.
For instance, you’ll avoid looking at your inbox, where the dreaded email awaits, or
make sure your eyes never slow down long enough to read its loathsome subject
line.
You’ll think as little as possible about people who might remind you of the task. And
whenever you do remember it you’ll immediately try to focus on some other
distraction instead.
After all, you won’t do the task, so why suffer the pain of thinking about it, and your
perpetual failure not to do it?

It’s serious
While on one level this behaviour is quite funny, as a psychological phenomenon it’s
no joke. Most of us have had days or weeks ruined by an ugh task hanging over our
head, pushed out of mind but always haunting our stream of consciousness, sitting
just out of view.
In severe cases, it drives people into depressive episodes that rob them of months
or years of their life.
At a social level, the ugh problem is probably getting worse due to the rise of emails
and text messaging (anyone can add an unwanted to-do to your list), knowledge
work (it’s less clear when you’ve finished something or whether you’ve done a good
job), and remote work (at no point in the week do you get to relax knowing there’s no
way you could be doing your ugh task right now).
And pity poor PhD students whose entire programs seem designed to make their life
one enormous Ugh Field.

Limiting the damage
I don’t have a perfect way to escape this mental flytrap, but these things might help:
1. It’s worth trying to see the humour in this absurd design flaw in the human brain.
Ugh Fields happen to everyone, even very conscientious people.
There’s no more reason to feel ashamed about them than there is to feel ashamed
that you enjoy eating food. It’s just how people are built, and sadly there are no brain
engineers around to roll out a patch to the human race. We just have to find practical
workarounds instead.
2. Simply recognising and labelling the Ugh Field phenomenon can make it less
harmful because it provides an accurate systemic explanation for what’s going on,
rather than a misleading personal one like, “I’m hopeless and never get things done.”
3. Because you’ve been avoiding thinking about the problem, if you do think about it
for a bit while keeping an open mind, you might quickly strike on a way to get out of
the task entirely, or if not, do a shorter version of it.
For example, you could email back something like: “Thanks for your patience on this.
Unfortunately, I don’t see how I’m going to be able to fit it into my schedule just now,
is there anyone else who can take it on?”

4. If you think about it calmly, you may well find that the task actually isn’t as
important as it has come to feel. The person you imagine is disgusted by your failure
may only be 2/10 annoyed, or perhaps not even have noticed.
Remember, like you, they’ve got plenty of their own stuff going on.
5. Usually, by the time something is deep in an Ugh Field, it’s no longer the most
productive thing you could be doing anyway. Especially relative to the willpower it will
now require. So consider deliberately dropping it in favour of something more
motivating.
Actively cross it off your to-do list. Throw away those New Yorkers you’ve been
planning to read for months but never get to, or whatever else will be a nagging
reminder of the task.
You have more valuable things to do; the task is gone.
6. Hire/ask someone else to do it.
For example, if you’re procrastinating on your taxes, maybe it’s time to accept it’s
worth paying a professional.
Or if you have to write an unpleasant and overdue email, get a friend or family
member to draft it for you. It will likely be much less unpleasant for them because it
won’t be emotionally charged and marinated in shame.
7. Ugh Fields occur more in people with depression, anxiety, ADD, and other mental
health and energy issues. If they’re a constant issue for you, it might be best to try
tackling those underlying health and well-being issues first and foremost.
8. There’s the usual large literature on overcoming procrastination. I won’t repeat it
all here.
9. Over time, learn to recognise tasks that are likely to end up in your ‘Ugh Field.’
The worst offenders are things that are kind-of unpleasant to do, get more
unpleasant as you delay, and have no clear deadline or expiry date.
Before taking on any optional responsibilities, reflect on whether they’re likely to get
‘Ugh Fielded.’ If they will, do everything you can to steer clear of them before you
even start.
10. If you’re a line manager, talk periodically with the people you’re managing about
whether anything at work has gotten ‘Ugh Fielded.’
If something has, don’t be judgemental, simply find a way to give it to someone else.

There are many reasons to do this: i) it probably won’t get done by the original
person now, ii) if it is it will be either late or bad, iii) regardless it will make them
miserable in the meantime, iv) which means it’s going to cost you a lot of other work
they could be doing — work you’d probably value more, and v) someone else can
likely do it way easier now anyhow.
Hope this helps!

3 Code Metrics Every Developer
Should Know | by Miloš

We need code metrics, to pinpoint smelly code. We all know bad code when we see
one. Even so, sometimes it slips through.
Bad code resides in big codebases where developers come and go.
The leaving developer doesn’t care, does a bad job, and leaves. You join the team
and encounter a code mess.
You need valuable code metrics to combat bad code.
Even when you see team members writing bad code, you need to point it out. It will,
sooner or later, end up on your plate.

1. What is code churning?
Churn is a measure of how often a file changes. Files that
change more have higher churn. — Sandi Metz
https://sandimetz.com/blog/2017/9/13/breaking-up-the-behemoth
Complex code with most changes lives in the top right corner. This is your Util
class. This is your Manager class. This is where your core logic resides, so no one
wants to touch it.
Either way, you make changes, causing bugs and tech debt along the way.

3 Code Metrics Every Developer Should Know | by Miloš Živković | Level Up Coding

1

Michael Feathers talks about this code metric. He even developed software to find
these churned files. These are the best candidates for refactoring.
When can we use this metric? Use it in your technical grooming sessions. Pinpoint
which most churned class, evaluate tech debt, and start refactoring.
Most software quality measuring is static. Sonarqube, lines of code, and other code
quality metrics. Code churn metric adds another dimension with version control.
Code churning is done in big classes. We get pulled into it, as Sandi says, it has its
own gravitational force.
Why add a small helper class, when you add logic in a 500 line class? We are all
guilty of this behavior. The need to iterate faster leads to more code churn.
More on code churning implementation in the article below.

2. What is the ABC metric?
The first mention of this metric was in an article by Jerry Fitzpatrick. This is an
extension of cyclomatic complexity.
Not only Conditions make up this metric, but also Assignments and Branches.
Hence the name Assignments, Branches, Conditions metric.

ABC is a measure of complexity. — Sandi Metz
ABC metric tells more about the code complexity. If the score is high, your code is
complex.
For the sake of this article, I’ll post the formula. For those math nerds, reading this
here is the formula. There are few tools that calculate this metric, and you can find
them in the wilderness.
|ABC| = sqrt((A*A)+(B*B)+(C*C)) - calculating ABC score

I am a Java developer. How can I count the As, Bs, and Cs in
Java?
https://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/edu/2ip30/references/ABCmetric.pdf — Pg. 8 in PDF
Why should we care about this metric? What are the benefits of it?

3 Code Metrics Every Developer Should Know | by Miloš Živković | Level Up Coding

2

Humans make mistakes, metrics don’t. You can’t manage what you can’t
measure.Use metrics to improve. Metrics won’t lie.

3. What is cyclomatic complexity
An algorithm that counts the number of unique execution paths
through a body of source code. — Thomas J. McCabe
You’ve seen code with a lot of if-else blocks. Example of bad cyclomatic complexity,
or high score of cyclomatic complexity.
Writing OO programs leads to reduced cyclomatic complexity. Extract conditional
logic into separate classes. Then inject it into your class.
I wrote more on how to reduce this metric here. Adhering to OO principles vastly
reduces this metric.
When you face code with a cyclomatic complexity score of 10, you should refactor.
McCabe states developers who knew structured programming, wrote optimal code.
Even before he invented the metric. I wrote about developing structured programs
here.
Code with high cyclomatic complexity is hard to test. By definition, tests should cover
all execution paths. Think of code with a cyclomatic complexity of 50, you’d need 50
test cases.
Sandi Metz points the reverse way of using this metric. Use it to know if you’ve
written enough tests. For example, you have a code with a complexity score of 40
but only 20 tests. You need more tests to cover all paths.

Conclusion
Code metrics are used to navigate us through the project. They tell us where the
stinky code part is living. Where we need to clean up.
No one says you need them. For your hobby project, local gym, or MVP they might
not be of benefit.
Things get interesting if the project succeeds. Codebase grows bigger, and then they
are essential for the life of your project.

3 Code Metrics Every Developer Should Know | by Miloš Živković | Level Up Coding

I use metrics, at least the cyclomatic complexity, to break up my code. This leads to
testable code and reasonable code chunks.
You should take away at least one metric, and implement it today.

Easter egg: Cobra effect
Don’t create work out of code metrics. Don’t provide perverse incentives to do so.
This goes well with the Cobra effect. People breed cobras, kill them, and collect
rewards from English colonialists. The goal of killed cobras was to reduce the
cobra’s population. People saw the reward only, not the problem behind it.
What can this story teach? Don’t use metrics to produce more work. Use them
proactively to do better work. Using metrics reactively leads to the “Cobra effect”.
Produces work that is not needed for the business, but can increase your time on the
project.

Hoje, eu quero compartilhar com vocês os top 3 motivos
pelos quais os desenvolvedores podem acabar sofrendo
com o burnout.
Se você não sabe o que é burnout, é basicamente um
estado de esgotamento físico e emocional que pode
afetar qualquer pessoa, mas que é especialmente
comum entre programadores.
Motivo 1: falta de reconhecimento pelo seu trabalho.
Muitas vezes, a gente trabalha horas e horas em um
projeto e não recebemos o devido crédito por isso seja
por parte da empresa ou dos nossos colegas.
Motivo 2: a pressão constante por prazos apertados. O
que acaba prejudicando a sua saúde mental e física.
Sem contar, que normalmente esses prazos são
arbitrários e criados por pessoas que não entendem a
complexidade do trabalho envolvido.
Motivo 3: falta de autonomia no trabalho e a falta de

It will help you reduce rework and enhance your
overall career

Who/what, according to you, is a programmer’s best friend?
Some say coffee, others say keyboard shortcuts but I think it is Stack Overflow.
Always there to help, through thick and thin. Doesn’t matter if the problems are small
or big, it is always there.
But sometimes the answers you seek aren’t there and you have to just grind it out
until it works. I guarantee that you have been in that place many times. Sometimes
that grind can be hours, and all the motivation flies out the window.
There are a few things that I have learned working on several projects apart from the
new technology/language/framework is the need for documentation and the ability to
see the holistic view of the system.
This may sound very simple and obvious but not very common amongst the
developers. I have seen several times that the problems that pop up during
development are quite similar. And even if you have solved them in the past, you
tend to google and find the exact solution.
This approach works every time but there is a lot of searching and scrolling, as not
all solutions are simple. You have to scroll through various posts and various
answers on Stack Overflow just to reach the one that solves your problem. It can be
frustrating at times.

3 Powerful Habits for Effective Developers | Level Up Coding

1

These three habits will help you reduce the turnaround time for a problem and will
enhance your understanding overall.

1. Document The Problems
A lot of times during development, we stumble upon a lot of issues with the libraries
and frameworks that we use. It is more apparent while using new technologies like
Spring Boot with Kotlin instead of Java.
We generally have all the context and understanding of the problem at hand when
we are developing the feature. And naturally, that becomes the best time to
document the problem.
Recently I was working with Hibernate with Kotlin and I bumped into a problem
where it was not possible to use data classes to create entities. I struggled for
sometime before actually finding a nice article that explains the problem and the
possible solution. I saved that link.
And instead of jumping quickly to the solution and implementing it to my problem, I
started digging deeper. I observed that there are a lot of libraries that have similar
problems because of the compatibility issues with Kotlin. Next time when I see
something like that I can quickly go through that article to refresh my memory and be
done with the solution.
Don’t try to quickly finish the task that you have on your plate, instead try to learn
and document as much as you can!

2. Create Architecture Diagrams
This one is very important for all the developers out there. No matter what level you
are. You should be good at looking at the bigger picture of any software system.
When you start creating the architecture diagrams, you start realizing how much you
do not know about the system. This gives you an opportunity to dig deeper and
understand the system well.
I generally try to understand the complete picture of a software system. I start by
looking at the backend server, understanding how the infrastructure is configured,
and third-party dependencies. Getting a quick view of the complete system helps me
understand what are the moving components in the system, regardless of whether I
would be working on that directly.

3 Powerful Habits for Effective Developers | Level Up Coding

The next thing I do is to draw a rough diagram of my understanding. I miss a lot of
important information during the first version but I get better by iterating and asking
questions to relevant people. A diagram much like a picture is worth a thousand
words. Refer to this link to understand various types of architecture diagrams.

3. Maintain a Daily Log
Very simple and very effective. Maintain a daily log of the work that you do. Try to
highlight the most important things that you do on a particular day. It will not take
more than 5 minutes.
Writing about the problem you stumbled on a particular day would be the first thing to
document. Try to be detailed and mention relevant information. Also, make sure to
note the things that are pending on you or the things that you need from other team
members. It could be either new designs from the design team or the scope of a
particular feature from the product owners.
This will help you make sure that you are not forgetting anything. You will be
proactive in approaching people and able to finish things quickly. This is one of the
things which can differentiate you from the rest of the crowd.
A developer’s day can be very busy sometimes, with all the meetings and delivery
pressure. And when you forget something to implement or change, no matter how
tiny it is, it can lead to huge problems.

Conclusion
These are a few things that have worked well for me. It made a lot of difference while
I was doing my daily work. It had positive impacts on my visibility in the team and
made me a reliable developer. I hope this helps you become a better version of
yourself.

3 Ways to Network When You Work Remotely | Forge

A few months into this unexpected workplace experiment, it turns out: We’re kind of
into it.
One June survey of people forced to work from home by Covid-19 found that 82%
wanted to continue doing so at least two days per week, and 35% wanted to
continue full time.
The problem is: We like being around each other, too. And, professionally, we need
it. Many of our best new opportunities come from encounters with other people.
When you sit somewhere new in the office cafeteria you could learn about an
opening in another department. In pre-meeting chitchat, a client might give you a
lead on a new opportunity.
We’re all experimenting with how to work without the accidental but potentially deep
connection that face-to-face conversations facilitate — even when it’s just two
colleagues greeting each other in a hallway.
Digital networking is possible, but it’s rarely effortless.Here’s how to do it well.

Say “Thank you”
Expressing gratitude renews ties with someone you haven’t talked with for a while,
and it’s always welcome. One study found that people actually underestimate how
happy recipients will be when they receive thank-you letters. Your manager from
three jobs ago would love to hear how you used the presentation skills that she
helped you develop. “Thank You” is also an excellent subject line for cold emails to
people you admire — even if it’s just to thank them for the work they put out into the
world.
While this habit’s immediate payoff is feeling good about the world, the secondary
benefit is connection: learning what past connections are up to, or creating an
opening for a friendly chat. Your old manager might know somebody who would be
perfect for that role you’re trying to fill, or that product designer you admire might be
willing to meet for a coffee.
Sending thank-you notes can be quick, simple — and productive for future work.
Emily Monaco notes in The Muse that every time she files a story, she makes a list
of the people who helped, and drafts thank-you emails, which she then sends once
the link goes live. Sometimes she gets no response, but often she does. “One PR
rep I wrote to thank for help locating a source followed up with a list of other clients
she was working with, which ultimately led me to find the perfect source for an
upcoming story.”

Make introductions
You can build a vast network by developing the discipline to reach out to a few
people each week.
Introductions not only help other people make friends and connections, they can
make both parties feel more connected to you. To do these well, writes networking
expert Kelly Hoey in her book Build Your Dream Network, don’t just send a “you two
should know each other” email. “I refer to these sorts of emails as ‘dump and drive,’”
she writes. “Dropped in someone’s email inbox without context (or permission), this
sort of message typically leaves recipients cold to the introduction because they are
left to figure out why the introduction was even made.”
Instead, make double opt-in introductions. Email or call both people separately and
ask if they would like to be introduced. Since both know you, they are likely to say
yes, but you want to make sure people are willing, and have the capacity to follow up
This also allows you to check that you have both parties’ correct information (useful
if someone just left a job or moved).

Do favors
The human drive toward reciprocity is so strong that research has found that we feel
the need to reciprocate for kindnesses; to “pay it forward” (do nice things for others
when someone does something for us); and even to reward others in our network
that we see doing good deeds.
You can generate a lot of activity by putting something positive into the universe —
and you can do that from your kitchen table as easily as from a regular office.

A tertiary education is important but some things
look even better on a resume
Don’t get me wrong — a tertiary education is important, especially if you attend a
school that is closely linked with the industry. It usually provides good pointers and
sound fundamentals of what computer science is.
However, in the internet-driven world we live in, if you want to start your career as a
software developer, your Computer Science degree should not be the most
important point in your resume.
So what are the 5 things better than a computer science degree? They are listed
below, ordered from easiest to hardest.

Technical Social Media
Who doesn’t like social media? If you’re not into some of these platforms, you might
have studied the wrong course.
For the sake of your career, join some technical forums. There are many in Twitter,
LinkedIn, Reddit, and Slack.

Separate your personal and technical account

5 Things Better than a Computer Science Degree | by Elye | Better Programming

1

Preferably don’t mix that account with your personal account. This is to ensure you
are linking with a focused group of people, who are interested in the same topic.
In your resume don’t link your private Social Media account, as that is not adding
much value, instead add your technical account, where your followers are not your
dad, mom, casual friends, but people of technical interest.

Technical account? Is this going to be boring?
Not really. People don’t only share technical blogs, questions and answer. Often
there are interesting stories, cartoon, or relevant jokes:

Be active…
Of course, don’t just share jokes or be a silent participant.— you won’t gain any
followers that way. Share your findings, thoughts and comments on relevant posts.
You’ll be amazed by the different thoughts and ideas that other people come up with.
Some idea that you think is perfect might be viewed as totally flawed by other
parties, with seemingly solid reasoning. That’s how you learn.

It’s a complimentary tool
I personally won’t have this as my only “other than Degree Certificate” profile to post
on my resume. I treat it as a complimentary feature to other aspects that I have.
What I mean by other aspects are the remaining 4 things that I’ll share with you
below…

Scoring on Stackoverflow
We are fortunate these days to have stackoverflow, with so many answers to our
programming inquiries. It’s a huge community — search a programming query online
and you’ll usually see some StackOverflow links.
When we look at StackOverflow questions and answers, we autoomatically hold
users with high scores in high regard.
So in other words, if you had that score, it would look good on your resume. These
scores are not merely approved by a single institution, but by a whole community
acknowledging the quality of their questions and answers.

A little by little
5 Things Better than a Computer Science Degree | by Elye | Better Programming

2

Everything starts with a single step. Probably your first step on Stackoverflow will be
asking a question to which you have not found any answers.
It is very important that your question is clear and easily understood. If it needs a
diagram to illustrate, draw it; if it you need to show code, share the git repo.
Most importantly, narrow down the problem to the specific area of confusion you
have. Don’t dump your whole project code up there and expect the reader to
understand it. You might be surprised to find that while narrowing down the issue,
you have found the solution (e.g. a silly mistake somewhere).
A clear and succinct question will usually get a response, especially in a field where
there is lots of interest. Even if no one responds to it, that’s fine — don’t give up. Do
your own research and you might find the answer. If you do, answer your own
question — some day someone out there will benefit from it.
In other words, don’t hesitate to post your question, even while you’re searching
elsewhere for the answer. Even if you find a solution somewhere else, you might be
given a better answer on Stackoverflow.

Be generous in your voting
If someone answers your questions well, do vote for them.
Try to find one best answer to uptick, instead of leaving it in a limbo, where no one
knows what’s your preference answer. Besides, you’ll get 2 points for uptick an
answer.
Of course if there’s no best answer to your question despite multiple one out there,
then don’t just uptick for the sake of getting the 2 points. Be truthful to yourselves.
The 2 points is not worth trading with your integrity.
Similarly, up vote good questions. Help build a good community that appreciates
others contributions and you will get your fair share.

It builds overtime
The scoring in StackOverflow is cumulatively incremental — the earlier you
contribute, the quicker you’ll get scored. You’ll be surprised at some of your
unexpected asked questions and answers that get popular. You’ll continue to gain
points without doing much.
It is also a good place to document hard problems you found and their solutions.
Many times I have gone to a StackOverflow post I made in order to extract the
solution of an issue I have forgotten.

5 Things Better than a Computer Science Degree | by Elye | Better Programming

It is not hard…
This is actually a simple platform on which to get recognition from the community —
you just need discipline. Even if your question is not written in the best way, people
will take the effort to improve it.
It is still relatively easy and yet rewarding. Check out the below post for more

Blogging on technical topics
Learning and recording what we learned is a good habit to get into, especially when
we discover things that we didn’t find documented anywhere else. Sometimes we
learn something from a tutorial and development document, but it took a while to
digest them, so we add some highlights and side notes to make it more
understandable.
Why not share these learning experience with others? Make other people’s learning
experiences easier. Blog for the good of everyone!
About 3 years ago, I joined a consultant firm, and was encouraged to blog. From
then on I started blogging — it has become part of me now.

What’s in it for me?
If it sounds like Blogging is only benefiting others, you’ll be surprised how much I
gain from it, other than something to add to my resume:
1. I notice learning gaps in the topics I blog about, so I go and learn them.

5 Things Better than a Computer Science Degree | by Elye | Better Programming

2. Many times I forgot what I have learned. Sometimes I go back to what I blogged
and remember it again.
3. Sometimes I received feedback on my blogs on a misunderstanding I have on a
topic, or some missing information. I learn from my readers!
4. I often received thanks and appreciation that my blog has helped readers. This is
very fulfilling!
5. A few of my blogs have been translated to other languages. To see people refer
to them made me feel my time spent writing and contributing to the community
was worthwhile.

What to blog
Well, I have written a blog about it sometime back, when I only have 20k views a
month and 40k a month.

I still use the same approach today, where I’m grateful to have about 140k viewers a
month. Many thanks to my viewers, as that encourages me to contribute!

This is the most feasible thing to do..
To me this is the most feasible thing to do as …
1. Each blog took on average a few hours of effort
2. After it is written, it’s maintenance is almost zero, unless someone comments for
correction
This is where my limit is. I did try the next two suggestions, but only in a limited way.

If you think you could do better than me, read on!

Create an open source library
Coding as an intellectual property is now history. The new trends these days are
around open source. Collaboration and work across different geographical location is
the way moving forward.
Why not jump on the bandwagon and be part of the open source community? Start
by contributing to some other peoples open source. One day you’ll notice something
you need (and possible other people need) that is not readily available out there.
Then create your own open source and share it to all.

A product at a smaller scale
An open source library is mini product, but unlike actual products, its audience is
developers. So there are less concerns around marketing, user design and so on.
You only need to focus on the coding side of it, so it has a far lower cost.
Compared to building actual products, open source cost is relatively smaller. If your
open source becomes popular, you’ll get other contributors wanting to add in
features to it, they will make a Pull Request. Your job is to review the Pull Request
(PR) and decide whether to approve it.
I have an open source which I created 3 years ago. Since then I haven’t updated it
much. Yet it still gets updated, even to the latest Android X version, without me doing
anything. I just need to review, test it, and re-upload.

Focus on technical learning
As it’s named open source, provide all your source code to others. So if any bugs
(hopefully not stupid ones) are found, other contributors will notify you and even
make a PR to fix it. From there you get free testing, as well as fixes — nice!
All these are technical inputs and discussion. The focus is on the technical side. You
will get less input on marketing, product and usability concern.
If there’s some usability lacking in your open source, contributors will add it
themselves — you don’t even need to worry about it.

Some real cases
Can open source make a person’s career?

5 Things Better than a Computer Science Degree | by Elye | Better Programming

Among Android developers, everyone knows Jake Wharton. He started off with open
source and now his work is known by almost all serious Android developers. He now
works for Google.

It’s not that simple
Although writing open source is not too hard to maintain (as others would help to
maintain), has less initial cost (don’t need design, market planning etc), and is
focused on technical, it still has its own challenges.
The likelihood of creating an open source that will be adopted by many is not high.
To create each open source takes time, effort, thought, and coding architecture
considerations. To review PR, test and upload take time as well.
I don’t think just anyone could create a lot of popular open source. There aren’t
many people as talented as Jake Wharton!
If this doesn’t challenge you, and you think you could stretch even further, and want
to do something more real life and related to everyone, check out the next possibility.

Build a real software product
In the 70s, engineering was the hot course many wanted to study. However, these
fields could hardly teach you produce something useful on your own. Even if you
could produce it, you would then have to to market it to everyone or no one would
know your product.
Fast forward to today. Creating a Webpage or an App on your own is so much
simpler. Marketing it to the whole wide world on your own might not be easy, but to
have it reach 10,000 users is not an impossible feat anymore.
So having an actual product (not just a school or uni assignment), publicly available
with good user feedback, on your resume has a great deal of value.

5 Things Better than a Computer Science Degree | by Elye | Better Programming

A holistic experience of learning
Having an actual product gives you the complete experience in building an App —
from the ground up to publishing it for the public to use. Every technical aspect
needed in building your product will be learned during the process.
Besides technical learning, you’ll also gain valuable insights into marketing your
product. Suddenly you realize that every single nuance of design is important and
that your work flow can make or break your design. It’s not just the technical aspects
of it — to make it better, you have to know your user behavior, and which features
work and which don’t. Analytics is another topic you’ll get into. You will gain such
valuable experiences!
Then you realize you can no longer do a great job as just a single person.
Nevertheless, you’ve done at least one to know what is it to put a product out there.

A real case
I know of a Korean friend, who did not speak good English, looking for a designer job
in an English speaking country. Despite her language issues, by having her profile
ready on the web she could easily show the interviewer her work. She got the job
without even speaking much English! (Now her English has improved tremendously.)
As everyone knows, the founders of Google, Microsoft, Facebook and others started
building their products while pursuing their degree and they have not looked back
since.

It’s difficult… but
While having a successful product will give lots of weight to your profile — in fact
could be a career and business in itself — it is a very difficult job to maintain it, let
alone grow it.
More time and investment will be needed over time. As technology changes, you’ll
need to update your product. If you’ve already ended up with a full time job, perhaps
have got married and had children, maintaining your personal product on a regular
basis would be a challenge.
Well, that’s my excuse! Look at Bill Gates, Steve Job, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page,
Sergey Brin — if they can do it, why not you? You might be the next one!

I have almost a decade of experience as a software engineer, and during this time I
already been in many situations that made me grow as a professional.
In this article I want to share some tips, that you can start applying today, in order to
grow fast as a software developer.

6 Career Boosters for Programmers | by Henrique Mota | Full-Stack tips | Medium

Looking Correctly To Your Colleagues
Have you ever felt a little bit jealous about a colleague? He has done something
amazing and you wished it was you. Chill out that’s ok, it’s from our human nature
and from the messages that society passes to us.
If you think about it, this doesn’t bring you any advantage, indeed this is very bad for
your career, you should understand that working with people that make amazing
things, will make you close to do something similar.
After you understand that this is something that you can work, start by chatting with
your colleagues, share some ideas, ask some advices, offer your help. If you are in a
healthy company this will be a very natural process.
On another hand if you don’t have this environment in your company, work your mind
and you will attract this company into your life.
Another good thing of seeing your colleagues as allies instead of enemies is building
a network of people that enjoy to work with you. This can be valuable in the future.

Programming Languages as a Tool

6 Career Boosters for Programmers | by Henrique Mota | Full-Stack tips | Medium

2

This is a very controversial topic. I see so many programmers worship a single
programming language and ignore the rest and in my opinion this is so bad.
Let me tell you why…
When you worship something you became slave of that thing. Isn’t suppose to be
the inverse? You should use a language as your slave and not be the slave of a
language.
How to overcome this?
Well, first you must realise that a programming language is more than a tool to
materialise ideas, it is also a tool to shape the way you think.
Make an exercise, let’s suppose that we have the array [1, 2, 3], now I ask you how
to double every number in the array. I bet you will think in the solution with the
languages that make part of your life.
So learn more languages, learn algorithms, learn concepts and be free from this
slavery.
I can recommend you two books to help you achieve this. The first one is to learn
algorithms in a fun way. The second is to learn 7 different languages.
You can see them:
Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other
curious people
Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: A Pragmatic Guide to Learning
Programming Languages (Pragmatic Programmers)

Evaluate Correctly the Work You Do
It’s very common in software development suffer from the impostor syndrome and
this has a little bit to do with the first topic.
That feeling that you don’t deserve the salary you earn at the end of the month and
that you are an impostor.
First you have to realise that you passed an interview and as long as you give
everything of you to learn with humility and responsibility, you have nothing to fear
about.
Learn to value your evolution as a programmer and understand that you have your
own pace. Be tolerant with yourself, be open minded.

Your Values as a Professional
Become a good software engineer, by doing your work so well, that if you leave your
company it will be easy to replace you as a programmer.
Maybe they will miss your professionalism, your inspiration but be missed because
your code is so bad that you are the only one that can change it, is not very grateful.
Learn to choose good variable names and functions, to divide your code into
modules, to develop tests. Do the best to ensure that your colleagues understand
your code and that it works after you change anything. Do this and you will be
respected by your colleagues.
To help you, I recommend you the book Clean Code by Uncle Bob.

Soft Skills
Technical skills are the pearls that makes you a programmer, but in a world full of
opportunities you must work your soft-skills.
I was born shy and introvert, two characteristics that made me suffer even in my
career. In this situation I learned to have cold blood and focus on the escape.
Don’t get me wrong I’m still shy, but I learned to control my shyness. But forcing
myself to overcome this situations compensates me for the journey and for the
returns.
Be proactive, tackle your weakness, leave your comfort zone and in the end you will
be recompensed by this attitude.
I can recommend you two books that made the difference to me:
Gorilla Mindset
Soft Skills: The software developer’s life manual

Looking Forward
Another underestimated exercise, is to think what you want to achieve with your
career. If you don’t visualise where do you want to be in the next 5 year, how the hell
are you going to walk the path that will make you happy?
Sit down in your chair or sofa and do a little research, see the market trends, explore
every option and see where you want to go.

Developers build enterprise solutions to address complex business problems and
customer-facing apps to make life easier for the end-users. The development
process can be quite challenging and requires numerous tools that can assist the
solution architects and developers.
There are numerous software tools available to assist and streamline the
development team and decrease their cognitive load. These tools help you as a
developer to concentrate more on creating robust solutions and meeting deadlines.
So here is a list of fairly uncommon but very effective tools that will assist you in
improving your deliveries and turnarounds.
Typora
Typora is a minimal WYSIWYM Markdown editor. It boasts of simple yet aesthetic
formatting options. There are five standard themes available and dark mode being
one of them (and also my favorite).
You can add headers, lists, code fences, inline styles, mathematics, images, etc in
Typora. You get a distraction-free environment with the help of focus mode and
typewriter mode. In the former, only the current line that you are working is in focus,
rest are blurred and in the latter, the currently active line is placed in the center of the
screen.

You can integrate it with Github, Adobe Illustrator, Google docs, and Markdown. It
supports word count, code blocks, and syntax highlighting. The seamless live
preview comes in handy for assessment and to make changes accordingly.
You can get it for all operating systems, albeit the Mac OS is in beta right now.
Tuple
Take your cursor to the left, more left, no no shift a little towards right….okay, this is
not working out.
Before you go back to such conversations, I suggest you try your hand at Tuple.
Why?
Because Tuple has a focus ring to pinpoint the location, making life easier for you.
However, this is just not it! You also get to control your peer’s computer system
seamlessly with mouse and keyboard control. It is given to both the collaborators
facilitated by a single click pairing mechanism.
The audio quality is great and there is almost no lag. Furthermore, there is the
drawing option that lets you utilize your whole screen as a whiteboard. But as of
now, Tuple is limited to remote pairing on macOS only but it is worthy of a try for
sure.
Also, with many of us now working from home, collaboration is essential. Tuple is
quite useful here!
Codernotes
Codernotes combines the functions of a note-taking app, code editor, and runs the
same code without having to switch to other environments.
It lets you store code snippets, markdown notes, links, solutions for errors, and any
other concept that you wish to jot down. And don’t worry about losing notes because
you can’t remember the name of your notes, it’s ‘Google-like search system’ helps
you in finding the note within a short duration.
Codernotes has a heavy focus on community-based learning and makes sharing
knowledge in the developers’ world easy. It is cloud-based storage, has syntax
highlighting options and unlimited public notes feature. It is the ultimate
collaboration/learning platform for your team and getting access to developers
across the globe.
The Silver Searcher
The Silver Searcher is a code searching tool. It tops the most efficient productivity
tools for developers because of its speed. It’s similar to Ack but delivers results way

faster, some claim almost 34 times, but the jury is still out on that.
So the amount of time you spend searching code in thousands of code lines can
now be utilized for better things.
You have the editor integrations for Sublime Text, Vim, and Emacs. And you get to
install it on Mac, Linux, Windows, and BSD.
AutoHotKey
AutoHotKey is an open-source scripting language for developers to create your very
own hotkeys, letting you streamline any repetitive actions in Windows.
As a developer, you have complete freedom to your files, windows, and folders as
per your needs. Your macros and automation mechanism are in your hands. Apart
from hotkeys for mouse and keyboard, you can create shortcuts for joysticks too.
This free scripting language has the potential to save a lot of time and effort that
would otherwise be wasted on doing recurring tasks. You get to prototype faster and
use your experience to make it easier for newer developers to learn and adapt
quickly.
Mindly
Mindly is the only one in this list that is not limited to developers. None-the-less it still
has developer applications.
It gives you a place to collect, iterate, and organize all your crazy ideas. Its planetary
layout lets you collect complex ideas and piece them all together for better
comprehension for you and your team.
You can attach images, URLs, play with different color themes, take notes, export in
different formats (varies by OS and plans), and get a visual clipboard.
This is the ideal software for brainstorming with your team for projects and gives an
opportunity for mind mapping. You should give it a try to see how it works out for you
and your team.
Closing Note
The listed tools are focused on keeping your developers’ productivity levels at peak
while keeping the frustrations at bay. As it is, a developer’s life is filled with many
unknown errors and glitches waiting to pop up at the most inconvenient times.
Hopefully, these tools will help in automating the redundant tasks and keeps your
developers a tad bit motivated and happier.

6 ways to screw up when on-boarding software engineers | by Oded Magger | WeWork Technology

1

Did you ever join a new company, all pumped up and motivated, just to be
disappointed when you realize no one has any idea what to do with you?
Did you ever question your decision to join a company, or even doubt yourself, when
a few weeks after starting the new gig you realize you didn’t make much progress
since that first day?
You’re not alone.
Software Organizations invest so much on optimizing talent sourcing and work
processes, it’s amazing how the link connecting the two — engineer onboarding — is
often neglected.
As such, I’ve witnessed many software teams defer to a few common Anti-Patterns.
An Anti-Pattern is a common solution to a recurring problem or challenge, which is
ineffective at best and often harmful.
For those of us who are engineers — this is the equivalent of putting all of your code
in one giant class (AppManager, anyone?) or using the same nifty software
paradigm to solve every challenge you encounter.
In this post, I’ll point out common malpractices in Software Engineer onboarding,
mixing comedy and tragedy. If you’ve been around the block, I’m sure you’ve
experienced some of these first-hand. I sure did.
“Hmmm… let’s start with the first 300 pages.”

Learning Strategy Anti-Patterns
1. “The Bookworm”
On the first day on my student internship, I was handed a book on ARM
development.

- Expert: Here, read this.
Me: What should I read?
Expert: Hmmm… let’s start with the first 300 pages.
Being, well, a student, I spent the first couple of weeks reading the book
meticulously.
By the time I reached the 100th page, I forgot what the 50th. page was about.

6 ways to screw up when on-boarding software engineers | by Oded Magger | WeWork Technology

2

When I reached page 250, I was finally given my first task. Needless to say, I didn’t
have a clue on how to approach it, and here is why:
Most of the book was irrelevant. In the year I spent at that position, I may have
used perhaps 10% of the reading material. Tops.
I had no way to tell what’s important and what’s not because, well, I never
developed for ARM processors, nor did I do any low-level programming for that
matter. So, I didn’t even have an intuition on where should I focus. And hey, the
expert said I should read all of it!
I didn’t practice what I learned. The book was built to provide knowledge, not
to help assimilate that knowledge. And since I didn’t practice, the knowledge just
slipped my fingers.
It was BORING
…and overwhelming. Without focus and practice, I soon felt saturated and lost,
and my pace slowed dramatically.
Now, and this is super-important for later on:
Some folks thrive when they get the chance to read theory before diving into code.
It boosts their confidence and makes them feel like they have solid foundations.
Then again, I doubt they’d survive 300 pages of ARM development theory.

2. “Trial by Fire”
The exact opposite of “The Bookworm”. As soon as you sit by your new shiny laptop,
your team lead assigns you to a task.

- Me: How should I approach it? What should I know
beforehand? What’s the context?
Team Lead: Just read the code, you’ll figure it out. It’s just
code.
Now, some developers would proclaim that this makes perfect sense, as ‘the best
documentation is the code itself’, right?
Also, this technique supposedly allows the manager to gauge the newcomer in a
‘sink or swim’ fashion. If they’re good enough, they’ll stay afloat and succeed. If not,
well, it’s better to fail fast and send them on their way, right?

6 ways to screw up when on-boarding software engineers | by Oded Magger | WeWork Technology

3

I cannot stress enough how harmful this approach is.
First, this is super stressful to the newcomer, in a counter-productive way. They
know they’re being tossed into the water. They know they’re being tested. And some
people — good people, great programmers — become terrified and petrified by
that notion.
Even if they do pass the trial, they’ll spend their first several weeks frustrated,
stressed and afraid, rather than motivated and happy.
Furthermore, if the newcomers approach a task without guidance (or are afraid to
ask, as they’re being tested and don’t want to appear weak or needy), they’ll learn
very little from the experience. Fear inhibits one’s ability to learn, rather than
boosting it. So, when the time comes for that second task, they won’t be more
prepared.
And hey — if, as a manager, you feel you need to test new engineers after they’re
hired — why not improve the interviewing process instead?

3. “The Spoonfeeder”
The previous two Anti-Patterns emphasized lack of guidance as an underlying
issue. But there is such a thing as too much guidance.
My first professional development job was in the army. I underwent two weeks of
‘The Bookworm’, but then was assigned to a mentor. She was great. She showed
me everything I need to know, and narrated every task she worked on while I was
watching.
Luckily, she was so focused on narrating, she did not notice I literally fell asleep
several times while we were “pair-programming”.
When we approached a problem, she offered a solution right away. She also coded
it, providing some commentary on how and why she did things. For me, it was like a
live version of ‘the bookworm’, as I didn’t do anything myself and was merely
bombarded with content. None of it stuck, not until I started coding independently.

Organizational Anti Patterns
4. “The Stunned Scramble”
You walk into the room, and five heads turn towards you, shock and surprise in their
eyes. The person ushering you in — say, the group manager — presents you. “This

6 ways to screw up when on-boarding software engineers | by Oded Magger | WeWork Technology

is Kimberly, she’s the new programmer on the team, good luck!”.
Awkward silence descends on the room. It is apparent nobody has any idea what
to do with you. As if this is the first time ever in the history of everything a new
programmer joined a team.
What a shock!
This typically leads to someone — your team lead, a hastily-picked mentor , or the
friendliest person on the team— scrambling desperately and eventually going with
‘The Bookworm’ or ‘Trial by Fire’ as a way to occupy you.
Everybody sighs in relief as they believe they found a solution for that developershaped comet dropped at them from the heavens, at least until the next time
someone stuns them with another newcomer.

5. “The Orphan Programmer”
The more depressing sibling of The Stunned Scramble.
You see, you joined on a really bad time. There’s a version coming up. Oh, and a
critical bug. And also there’s a national holiday coming up, right?
Anyway, the team was doing fine before you joined it, so there’s no harm in you
taking longer until you become effective. It’s not like your salary comes out of your
direct manager’s pocket.
Unlike you, the existing developers are already effective, and for now they should
focus on the current crisis. They’ll get back to you later to help you ramp up. When
there aren’t any crises, deadlines or holidays, that is.

In the meantime, why won’t you grab that book and read the first
300 pages?
Dear managers, if you want new hires to feel like the made a grave mistake
signing with your company, that they’re not needed and not cared for- this antipattern is perfect for you.

6. “The Avalanche”
“Welcome to the company! No, don’t sit down. My name is Harry,
and we will spend today helping you get your bearings. We will
start with a two-hour review of our amazing company’s history,
6 ways to screw up when on-boarding software engineers | by Oded Magger | WeWork Technology

5

followed by a presentation of all of the company’s departments
worldwide. Then, my colleague will show you how to submit
reimbursement requests and ask for a day off. Someone from
finance will then brief you on your pension plan and help you fill
some legal forms. And speaking of legal, we’ll cap that off by
mandatory anti-harassment, integrity and information security
training.”
“What do you mean, that sounds a little too much? We don’t want
you to spend today verbally abusing a co-worker while stealing
data from their hard-drive. And even if you do, how would you
know how to take a day off so you could sell it to our
competitors?”
Don’t get me wrong. Your pension fund is important, and so are the company’s
history and values and knowing how to get reimbursed.
But joining a new company could be an overwhelming experience, so wouldn’t you
say some of that stuff could wait a little, while the newcomer eases in?

A solution to Anti-Patterns
Reading through these Anti-Patterns might make you think I’m contradicting myself.
So reading theory is bad, but going directly to real-life practice is bad? No guidance
is bad, but having guidance is also bad? What the heck?
The truth is, these anti-patterns are extremities, and onboarding engineers the
right way lies in balancing theory and practice, guidance and independence.
Moreover, as I said before, people are different and have different learning
habits. So, some engineers might actually be perfectly happy with some of the antipatterns I outlined. The secret is to tailor the onboarding experience to the
person being onboarded.
In my next post, I will outline how we onboard new engineers at WeWork
Technology, while maintaining balance and tailoring the onboarding experience to
the newcomer.

7 conversation starters to move
your role from execution
partner to strategic consultant |

https://wilreynolds.medium.com/7-conversation-starters-to-move-yourrole-from-execution-partner-to-strategic-consultant-aface004ef75

I’ve had several conversations with people at Seer now that I run strategy where
they ask me how to become more strategic, I took that advice and put it together
here.
First question to ask yourself is:
Does my client / manager see me as a consultative strategist, or an execution
partner?
Note: Execution partners are key to driving results, never get too far from that while
seeking to improve your consulting skills, your UBER X driver is an execution
partner…they help you get from location A to B, and if that is a job interview or a big
pitch, it’s critical to be there on time, it may not be strategic but it’s critical.

Anyone can talk, not everyone can back it up, always seek to be
strong on execution!
Anyway with that caveat said…if you are wondering if your client / manager sees you
as a thought partner do they ask you questions like these?
Here are sample “sights and sounds” I’ve seen when clients saw someone as
a thought partner:

7 conversation starters to move your role from execution partner to strategic consultant | by Wil Reynolds | Medium 1

What am I not seeing coming down the pike that could impact the results we
have?
How do our numbers stack up against competitors?
What am I not asking of you to do for us that I should be?
Should I consider solving this problem with another team?
Can I have a strategy session with you? I’d like to discuss more than the day to
day. I have a BIG idea/challenge I want your optics on.
What else does your agency do that could help us?
Even if you don’t have skill xyz in house, I’d like you to manage the other
consults we hire.
Note: if you are being managed by a consultant, you are the execution partner.
I have XYZ left in my budget, how might you recommend we spend it?
I heard about trend ABC, how would that impact me, how do I hedge against
that, do you think its a risk for me?
If I took all my budget and gave it to you instead of other partners, what do you
think you could do for me?
How big of a risk is this? Should I prioritize this in Q1, Q2, etc? Is this a 2017,
18, or 19 problem?
Can you help to connect these day to day tasks with our larger vision?
If you have read these questions and are thinking, I haven’t been asked these and I
want to be more consultative & seen as more of a consultant. Here is the secret
about getting questions like these:

The secret is that it was never executing what I was asked to do
that made my clients think of me as a strategic thought partner, I
had to show them something real that challenged their daily
reality that made them think of me as more than the guy they
hired for whatever task they thought they needed me to do.
The three ingredients you need to level up in that strategic consultant / thought
partner level are:

7 conversation starters to move your role from execution partner to strategic consultant | by Wil Reynolds | Medium 2

1 — Opinions You have to be ok taking data making an opinion and saying to your
client / manager, I might be wrong, but I believe (stress the word believe) that (blah
blah blah).
2 — Never lose sight of the goal Understanding your clients true goal, be careful of
confusing the outputs (tasks) you are doing with the outcome (why you are
performing those tasks).
3 — Downside — Protect their downside on your big ideas, always find a cheap
way to test, get data, refine, then go big.
With those three things, you can start asking questions like the ones below to start
your client thinking of you more and more as a thought partner and an execution
partner. Remember even if they say no, they will think of you differently.

Find a trend in their space and prepare a
high level 5 steps to prepare for said
trend:
We haven’t talked (trend) yet I’m seeing in your data, that (percentage) of your (task
goal) could be impacted by (trend), which could long term have a (percentage)
impact on (revenue goal). As such I’ve prepared an (duration) road map on how we
can tackle this growing trend. If it remains at (percentage growth YoY), I believe
(duration) works. However, if (percentage growth YoY) goes to (stretch number) then
we should (accelerate/decelerate) our time investment in (trend) by x
(months/quarters/years). Can I spend 5–10% of my time investigating this for you?
IRL message I’d send (given I’m in search marketing):
Hi Rich, we haven’t talked about answer boxes in search results yet, but I’ve put
together an analysis that shows the impact to your traffic looks to be about 20%,
which could ultimately impact your revenue via this channel by 10%, meaning you’d
miss your annual goals. Here is a 12 month road map, that shows how with 2–3
hours a month we can start to understand the problem, monitor it, and take some
small steps to address them. If for some reason this percentage jumps to 30% or
more (which we will be monitoring) we might want to accelerate this schedule to 9
months to take advantage of these moves early. I’m recommending to all clients to
take me up on 2–3 hours of work to take a look this month.

7 conversation starters to move your role from execution partner to strategic consultant | by Wil Reynolds | Medium 3

Find another channel that if invested in
could accelerate revenue:
I know you’ve hired us for (service), but I’m looking at the entire landscape of ways
to hit your (goal) and believe that an investment in (other channel) could get you to
(goal) (x percent) faster. If it were me, I’d double down on (other service) cutting
back (my service) by (percentage) for (months/quarters), may I spend 3 hours this
month with one of my colleagues in (other service) to see if my gut is right?
IRL message I’d send (given I’m in search marketing):
Hi Jenn, I know you’ve hired us for SEO, but I’m looking at recent changes with
Google and realizing we’ve lost more organic real estate. That has to have an impact
on organic’s ability to hit your goal this year, to be honest I think us taking a look at
your paid search opportunities could help us hit your overall goal by October this
year instead of eeking it out in December. I’d invest more of my time in finding ways
for SEO to help PPC, which means I’m going to have to cut back a few hours/month
on SEO tasks, to help bolster my PPC teams efforts. I think if I can do this for the
next 2 quarters, we’ll be in a position to pick back up on SEO 100%, instead of my
suggested 50% for the next 6 months. Can I spend 3 hours with my PPC team to
see if the opportunity is as big as I think?

Looking forward / needing more
investment:
What would you need to see from me in (duration) that would make you double
down on your investment in us? What data points would be an early indicator to
make you reconsider in 6 months?
IRL message I’d send (given I’m in search marketing):
Hi Bart, before we get started on this project, I’d love to see in your opinion what
would you need to see in month 6 to make you want to double your investment with
us? Also what would make you cut it at month 6? I want to build an early warning
system so that if we are not on pace to hit the goal you and I both know it and can
have the conversation early, and build a plan B.

Explain an execution risk:

7 conversation starters to move your role from execution partner to strategic consultant | by Wil Reynolds | Medium 4

In my opinion, based on my experience and the experiences of (my team/manager)
who have seen (number) of projects just like this one, even on our best day if you
and I are committed to moving heaven and earth for (project x) we have a
(percentage) change of failure if we don’t get (department/person) on board. How
could you and I work together to make them part of the solution at the onset, so we
can realize (x impact) in (y time).
If we get to (duration) and we don’t have (percentage) impact, I’m going to be
looking to pivot (project) into areas (a,b,c) where you and I have a greater sphere of
influence, which would likely result in an impact of (x) instead of our initial project of
Y).
IRL message I’d send (given I’m in search marketing):
Hi Crystal, I have gotten with 3 colleagues (including my director) who have seen 50
projects just like ours to ask them what makes projects like these successful and
what makes them fail, given what I know about your goals and your business climate
internally. I know you and I are extremely committed to the success of this project,
you and I also know that we need others to care as much as we do to be successful.
If we don’t get everyone on board in the design and UX departments, this project is
highly likely to stall, even with our full efforts and the best of intentions, how might we
get them involved? My manager and colleagues have given me these 5
recommendations that they have seen work in the past, let me know which one or
ones you think would work for us, and I’ll get on crafting the documents, trainings,
and presentations.
While we are best intentioned, I want to put on my calendar a “line in the sand” on
execution risk. I believe that if at 5 months we have not hit the following 3
milestones, that we would have gone from an 80% likelihood to a 30% likelihood of
hitting your goals of 3 million in revenue by Q3. As such, if we don’t, my plan B is to
at that time do the following 4 things, which are less impactful, but more within our
sphere of influence, so while I need everything to work out right to get that 3 Million, I
think if we run into execution roadblocks we can get to 2.3 Million of that 3 with these
other tactics you can I have more control over.

Realizing “full universe”:
Based on my experience & research, if we keep growing at (x), we’re likely to start
hitting peak market share attainment, I have confirmed with (number) colleagues (or
read x paper) who confirm that in the (x) industry, that is a reasonable expectation.
Given current trends we are projected to realize that ceiling in the next

7 conversation starters to move your role from execution partner to strategic consultant | by Wil Reynolds | Medium 5

(months/quarters/years). I recommend I spend (x) percent of my time, sniffing out
new opportunities as the marginal value of (current thing I am doing) should start to
dry up and not get the lift it once did, and I want to make sure we still are on pace to
attain (goal x) set by the executive team. I can get started on this in 6 weeks if we
approve this week. I’ll give you more details, just getting a temp check on this
concept.
IRL message I’d send (given I’m in search marketing):
Hi Sara, I have done some digging and if we keep growing at 120% we’re probably
going to start running into fewer and fewer opportunities at the current ROI we’re
driving. I’ve done my digging across the web, and spoken with a few execs here at
Seer who have come across this issue before. When I ran my projections by them
they agreed that there is a chance we could start topping out our impact in the next
18–24 months. I’d love to spend 10 hours this month finding new opportunities,
we’ve already hit goal for the year of 2 Million in revenue, and its 3 months to go till
your fiscal year. The marginal value of getting 10 links a month just doesn’t seem to
be paying the dividends they did when we started 3 years ago, I want to make sure
we start planning for the changes to come next fiscal year, so we can have a game
plan to hit goal for that year. Can I deploy that 10 hours and return to you what I
found & my recommendations?

Show them a new reality that destroys
current reality
I know you asked me to do (task) and to hit (tactical goal), I’ve attained that (x)
(months/quarters/years) in a row. However in that time I haven’t had time to research
(trend), and did you know that while I’ve been hitting your (tactical goal) I’ve been
ignoring (bigger trend). Who is watching your back on the rise of (consultative opp)?
May I work with them (or run it myself), to spend x% of my time this (month/quarter)
to build a plan to help us take advantage of (new reality). I believe that even if I get
(x) more of (tactical goal) the marginal value of that is smaller than the (wide open
field) that (competitor 1,2,3) are not even seeing. I feel that we’ll have (months) to
take advantage before all the others wise up.
IRL message I’d send (given I’m in search marketing):
Hi James, I know you asked me to work on improving quality scores in our biggest
spending categories, as a way of helping us to hit goals for the year. I’m glad to
report that for 4 months in a row within our top 5 campaigns, all keywords have

7 conversation starters to move your role from execution partner to strategic consultant | by Wil Reynolds | Medium 6

quality scores over 7!! I could continue to do that work, and I know it would be
fruitful, however we haven’t discussed the impact that app packs are having on our
mobile traffic at all in the last 4 months, and I believe that with 4 months in a row of
refinement on campaign quality score improvements, the time has come to spend
some REAL time on some risks I see for the business. We’ve been ignoring this
trend, and to be honest I think the lift we’ve gotten in QS isn’t as great as the lift we
could be getting if I invested that same time in optimizing your app rankings on
mobile.
Is anyone watching this at your company or is this report new to you?
I’m prepared to make the case and run the analysis to show the impact if you are
game for me pivoting this months time. Our top search competitors do not seem to
be noticing this trend yet either (that on mobile 32% of all results are showing app
packs), now is the time to strike, our competition won’t be asleep at the wheel
forever. We have 6–12 months before I think they’ll start playing with this too, lets get
a jump on them before they even know what hits them, let them keep obsessing over
the wrong metrics, we’ll be working on where things are going. I may have to bring in
a consultant or two to help us execute, but for now I just want to pull the data and
rate the risk and build a gameplan to make sure this pivot is worth the risk. The data
I pulled shows that if this continues to happen, 75% of the traffic that drives
conversions today will be unattainable by 2019. Rendering this channel ineffective. I
felt I owed it to you to let you know that if I keep doing what I’m asked, I think we’re
facing a MAJOR risk.

Show them you are studying outside of
your day to day:
I’m really into (tangential skill that impacts project). Today I got certified in XYZ. I
know it isn’t part of our project, but I’m willing to put in some extra hours (on me) to
see if with my new skills in (x) I can find (y) ways to help you hit goals for the year
and drive a wedge between you and your competitors for next year (they won’t even
see this change coming), look at the attached examples of them (and us missing this
opportunity). I believe that (current project) drives more value when (tangential skill)
+ (new skill) are brought together. I have already found these 3 ways that you can
get more value from (current project) by integrating the two. We’re currently on pace
to hit goal by (x date) I think if we can execute on these we can speed that up by
(timeframe).
IRL message I’d send (given I’m in search marketing):

7 conversation starters to move your role from execution partner to strategic consultant | by Wil Reynolds | Medium 7

Kim, howdy! I’ve been really into the issue of how users go from the search engine
to our client sites. I recently became certified in UX by the Nielsen Norman Group to
better be able to bridge expectations of users with what we deliver. I truly believe this
is a big miss by our industry, and with Google understanding better and better how
users interact with search results, I think it is more important than ever for us to
ensure that our top rankings are reliable for you to make forecasts on for years to
come, or we could lose those rankings, not due to lack of content or links, but due to
lack of understanding of what truly solves the users problem when they search for
Hospice in California. I don’t want to stall our current project one bit, so I’m going to
be going full bore with our plans, but wanted to know if on nights and weekends
when I get some extra time to see my my new human factors skills can help you
both with SEO but also to help ensure we are satisfying users.
Like I said before, I believe in the long term, Google will only get stronger (not
weaker) at understanding if a top ranking truly solves a problem and that is why I got
this certification. I’ve chatted with my managers and they’re behind me 100%, I’m
asking my clients if we can start to put some time to future proofing their projects.
Here are 3 examples of issues I found when I spoke to users looking to schedule an
appointment with someone, I think if we fixed those, not only could we get more
revenue from the traffic we’re already driving, but we’re also protecting those
rankings for the future. This will not distract us from our goal of 70 leads per month, if
anything it can help us get more, I project 77–82 leads per month as a result of this
work, helping us to BLOW out the goal and to maybe hit your stretch goal for the
year. While focusing on an area your competitors aren’t, setting us up for next year,
which again Google will only be stronger at than they are this year.
Hope I got you thinking, here are 3 more fill in the blanks that I was going to delete
but they just might help someone so I’m gonna leave em. :)

I want to get to know your customer better
I’m a better advocate for your and your customer if I understand them better. My
tools (x,y,z) are great at telling me (thing), but they don’t give me the qualitative
answers that would help me have more understanding of the bigger issue. May I
spend x% of my time this (month/quarter) on (sales calls, UX rebuilds, customer
support calls)?

Explain a cross functional opportunity:

I was reviewing your data and think there might be a larger opportunity for you to get
more from the investment you are already making with us. Do you mind telling me if
(channel x) is performing for you as well as it appears in the data?

Make a 3 year projection:
Over the next 3 years, I expect the investment you are making our work should have
y dividends.I’ve built a chart that shows what we need to hit each month in (data
point) to get to the 3 year goal your (executive) is seeking.

When Jerry started their job as a junior developer, they couldn’t wait to get to work
each morning. And each evening, even after their 10-hour workdays, they’d still feel
energized. Now, two years later, Jerry looks like the shadow of what they used to be.
Getting out of bed is hard these days, getting to work even harder. By the end of the
day, they feel exhausted and drained. And they’re already dreading the thought of
going back tomorrow and wasting yet another day of their lives.
Sounds familiar? Personally, I have yet to meet a programmer who hasn’t been
through at least one episode of burnout.
It sounds paradox: The same person who fell in love with code in their teens or
twenties, who have taken part in at least five hackathons over the past three years,
and who contributes to open-source projects on weekends — how can this person
possibly complain about burnout?

Yes, they can.

Reason 1: Monotonous work
Programming is sitting in front of a screen all day, except maybe for a lunch break
and a few meetings here and there. Sure, it’s the same in many other jobs. But the
intensity of staring-at-your-screen-while-sitting-in-a-very-unhealthy-position is highest
in programming.
Even if you find your work mentally stimulating, this monotony can quickly lead to
physical sluggishness. Which means that you don’t get your work done as fast, so
you start getting demotivated, so you work less, …
Getting out of this vicious cycle means adopting a healthy lifestyle. Which sounds
easy in theory. But the declining rates of life expectancy show how hard it is.

Reason 2: Rushing for deadlines
If you’ve ever worked with Scrum and similar methodologies, or if you have an
ambitious manager, you know what I’m talking about.

A Short Introduction to the Scrum Methodology
Or How I Learned to Embrace Change
medium.com
You’re chasing deadline after deadline. You’re probably missing a few deadlines
along the way. You’re expected to deliver everything by yesterday, and nobody cares
that humans aren’t capable of that.
As a result, when you’re thinking about your work, you’re not feeling a sense of joy
or accomplishment. You’re feeling pressure.
And that sucks all passion for coding out of you. You’re expected to be a robot that
always generates top-notch output and delivers it ahead of time. But you’re human,
so you respond with symptoms of burnout.

7 Reasons why programmers burn out | by Ari Joury, PhD | Towards Data Science

Reason 3: Coworkers that suck
Consider the following situation: Your project is exciting you and you feel you’re
making progress on it. Still, every day you dread going to work. The simple thought
of it is making you anxious and unhappy. What’s wrong?
Of course, your happiness at work is influenced by — well — your work. But even
more importantly, your happiness is influenced by your relationships — in or outside
of work.
So if you’re happy with what you’re doing but you’re still dreading it, it’s probably
your coworkers. No matter whether they just don’t share your values or whether the
corporate culture makes them act in stupid ways — you don’t deserve to be treated
nastily.
If you’re experiencing burnout symptoms that result from icky coworkers, know that
it’s not your fault. You might want to try some of the fixes listed further on in this
article. Or you might want to go a bit more radical and change departments or get a
job with a different company entirely.
It’s up to you. Just know that you deserve better.

Reason 4: No recognition
This part is related to your at-work relationships, but on another level. Your project
may be wonderful and exciting, and your colleagues may be awesome.
But whenever you feel like you’ve achieved something, your manager comes around
the corner with a totally different task. And every time they do that, the old task
becomes completely irrelevant.
Sounds familiar? I know it does to me.
You can be as excited or passionate as you like about your field. If your work
constantly gets invalidated, you’ll lose your motivation.
You’ll start dreading to go there because you know you won’t create anything useful
anyway. You’ll be happy when the day is over — because it’s over — but unhappy
since it isn’t Friday and you’ll have to go to work again tomorrow. And at some point,
you’ll start thinking that even the skills that you’re acquiring by completing your tasks
are irrelevant.
With time, this can lead to more severe symptoms. All because your manager has
no idea what you should be doing.

Reason 5: Getting paid
Getting paid too little — or too much! — can worsen your symptoms of burnout.
Too little pay is a no-brainer for burnout. (Yes, broke programmers exist!) If your
passion for coding isn’t enough to keep food on the table, you might not feel like your
work is valued. Which brings us back to reason 4.
But burnout can also worsen when you get paid too much. While a big check sounds
great in theory, it can lead to disaster in real life. Let me illustrate this with my
personal experience.
As an undergraduate, I got very involved in programming. I’d spend days and nights
at the research lab coding software for scientific purposes, sometimes even
neglecting my coursework for it. I loved it so much that I never expected any
compensation for it. For years I worked for free. Even if that meant that I couldn’t
even afford tomatoes at the supermarket.
This radically changed when I entered grad school. Suddenly I was being paid.
Suddenly all my bills were covered. Suddenly I could buy tomatoes without having to
think about the pennies. I was making a living. Of code!

7 Reasons why programmers burn out | by Ari Joury, PhD | Towards Data Science

5

And then a silly idea entered my mind: If I was being paid to code, then each month I
should be delivering a piece of code that is worth at least that amount of money.
Suddenly what had started as a wild passion became a source of pressure. Pressure
to deliver. Pressure to perform. Pressure to give back the value that I was receiving
in money.
But the more you pressure yourself, the less you’re going to perform. Especially
when you’re thinking about money.
Drowning in your tasks is a recipe for disaster. Photo by nikko macaspac on

Reason 6: Meaningless tasks
Reasons 3 to 5 tackle problems that you might encounter despite having a great
project. But sometimes your project just sucks.
Maybe your project is just a heap of corporate B.S. with not much substance for a
programmer. All you want is to code, and not take care of all the managerial duties,
customer relations and so on.

What every Data Scientist needs to learn from
Business Leaders
Because soft skills matter.
towardsdatascience.com
Maybe you’re not seeing the meaning in your project because you can’t learn
anything new from it. Programmers belong to the most curious creatures on this
planet — if you can’t learn from it, you don’t like it.
Maybe the project seems way beyond your skills. You feel that you’re unable to
master it, and that your manager completely over-estimated your skills.
Or maybe you’ve been working on a project for the past few months, and you still
can’t fathom what you’re supposed to be doing. The task is a mystery and nobody
seems able to explain it to you. This usually stems from mismanagement.
Unfortunately, this situation happens more often than you think.
In any case, from a corporate perspective, your project is your main reason to work.
So if it sucks, no wonder you’re experiencing burnout.

Reason 7: Walking the death march
This one is closely related to reason 6. The death march, in short, is when you’re
working on a project that is destined to fail.
This can have many reasons: The deadline is too tight, you don’t have enough
resources, or your team is too small to carry it out. Especially when it’s a big project
that you’re working on for many months, and when the stakes are high, this can lead
to a huge amount of pressure on your shoulders.
Your reaction to this can go both ways: Either you sink into complete apathy, come in
late and leave early because you know that your work isn’t going to change
anything. Or you start putting in 14-hour days in the belief that this way you could
turn things around.
Your apathy is caused by demotivation and leads to more demotivation. You’re
basically removing the fuel that keeps your fire going.
Or if you’re the type that gets buried in their work, you’re literally suffocating your
passion with all the time you’re investing into it.
Both of these are natural responses. As before, just know that if the project isn’t
going well, it’s not your fault. You’re an excellent programmer and you’ve probably

7 Reasons why programmers burn out | by Ari Joury, PhD | Towards Data Science

proven that on other projects. If this is going wrong, it’s because of the
circumstances and not because of you!

A Programmer Burnout Story; How to Recognize it
And Avoid it | CoderHood
I'll tell you a story of a software engineer named Bolbo, who at
some point in his career got caught up in a death march.
www.coderhood.com

Programmers are no robots
The tricky part about burnout is that what starts as a work problem splashes over to
all areas of life. You start neglecting your family, your friends, your hobbies, and your
self-care. And suddenly you’re not caught in a work crisis, but a life crisis.
It is vital to understand that — and I can’t stress this enough — this is not your fault.
Sure, recognizing your own mistakes is vital for personal growth. But blaming
yourself for mistakes you haven’t made will ruin you.
Most of the time, the root of the problem of programmer’s burnout is within the
company culture or some form of mismanagement.
That doesn’t mean that you need to change departments or quit your job right away.
While this might be a good solution for the really hard cases, working with a few
softer fixes can already do tremendous help.
Compassion is key. Photo by Jude Beck on Unsplash

7 Reasons why programmers burn out | by Ari Joury, PhD | Towards Data Science

Fix 1: Be compassionate with yourself
I know this sounds lame. But hear me out.
Burnout is not your fault. It is not a symptom of weakness. The pain you’re
experiencing is not from being an idiot. It is real. It is valid.
I stress this so much because I’m a culprit of this fallacy. I tend to blame myself for
issues that I didn’t cause and beat myself up when I should be nice to myself.
Being compassionate with oneself is something that I’m still learning. But the one
thing I’ve found is that this helps:

Be your own best friend.
This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t keep in regular contact with your besties. But try to
treat yourself like your best friend.
When you’re beating yourself up for your apparent ignorance, incompetence or
whatever, think of this: What would you tell your best friend if they were in your
situation? How would you talk to them?
Self-compassion, I have found, is an incredible hack for gaining more self-love. And
that leads to — you guessed it — more happiness and productivity.

Fix 2: Think about what used to excite you
I used to be so excited about programming, but I lost the spark when I entered grad
school. For me the reason was that I was getting paid (reason 5); but for you, it
might be any of the reasons stated above.
What helped were the memoirs of Nobel prize winning physicist Richard Feynman,
who was going through a period of burn-out when he received a job offer from the
very renowned Institute of Advanced Study:

Institute for Advanced Study! Special exception! A position better
than Einstein, even! It was ideal; it was perfect; it was absurd!
It was absurd. The other offers had made me feel worse, up to a
point. They were expecting me to accomplish something. But this
offer was so ridiculous, so impossible for me ever to live up to, so
ridiculously out of proportion. […] I laughed at it while I was
shaving, thinking about it.
And then I thought to myself, “You know, what they think of you is
so fantastic, it’s impossible to live up to it. You have no
responsibility to live up to it!”
It was a brilliant idea: You have no responsibility to live up to
what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no
responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It’s their mistake,
not my failing.
It wasn’t a failure on my part that the Institute for Advanced
Study expected me to be that good; it was impossible. It was
clearly a mistake and the moment I appreciated the possibility
that they might be wrong, I realized that it was also true of all the

other places, including my own university. I am what I am, and if
they expected me to be good and they’re offering me some
money for it, it’s their hard luck.
— From “Surely you’re joking, Mr. Feynman”, by Richard
Feynman, Copyright 1985, pg. 100.
Feynman wasn’t exactly coding. Still, it is this text that got me out of my rabbit hole
at the beginning of my PhD. From it I concluded, if my doctorate school is
overpaying me — then it’s their fault. I’ll be irresponsible like Mr Feynman and do
whatever the hell I like. And I did.

Fix 3: Incorporate routine tasks
Having to go to work when you know you’ll get nothing done is daunting. By
definition.
No matter whether the project is too hard, or mismanaged, or completely
meaningless — you’ll have to go without that dopamine surge that gives you your

7 Reasons why programmers burn out | by Ari Joury, PhD | Towards Data Science

11

happy groove.
One thing that can help reset your motivation is incorporating routine tasks. I like to
start my workday with something easy, almost trivial. The task should be useful, but
the main object is to get a tick off my todo-list.
This tricks my monkey-brain into wanting to fulfill the next task — because then I’ll
get another moment of accomplishment. I then slowly go from the easiest to the
hardest parts.
It sounds like procrastination of the difficult stuff. But it works! I’m surprised quite
regularly about how much I actually get done by doing the easy things first.

Fix 4: Reflect
Set some time aside each day to practice some reflection. Everybody has their own
technique, and you’re free to develop yours. I use a reflection matrix that I fill each
evening:

7 Reasons why programmers burn out | by Ari Joury, PhD | Towards Data Science

12

I separate active events from passive ones. An active event is a direct consequence
of what I did. A passive event is something that happens without me doing anything.
This helps me realize that not everything is in my control.
In the “I like” category I write things that I’m grateful for that day. This builds my
feeling of accomplishment and my mental resilience. This way I’m being proactive
against demotivation.
And the “I wish” category contains things that could have been better. This is where I
draw lessons and search for solutions — for example, I might set my milestones
differently or search for new ways to cope with my injury.

Minimalist Journaling: A Fun and Effective Tool for
Tremendous Habit Change
How to create your own habit dashboard that motivates you to
stick to any habit
medium.com
You can reflect using a journal, or by talking to a friend, or sending emails to
yourself. I advise you against doing it solely in your head — because you’ll forget
about it and it will be harder to build a habit. Also, the backlog will be fun to look
through later, believe it or not.
You can do this wherever you want — in your office, at home or in the park. But try to
do it in the same place each day — this will help you build a habit. Also, try to do it at
the same time each day, and ideally block this time out in your calendar.
By reflecting, you’re looking back on your past success. And you’re realizing that
every so often, you’re not in control of things. This has helped me a lot in coping with
symptoms of burnout.

Fix 5: Get a hobby
You’re a programmer. You’re a geek. I get it.
When you’re not at work, you’re either sleeping or coding for fun. And that’s
amazing.
But when you face serious burnout, you might not feel like touching a computer at
all. And now you’re faced with a big fat emptiness in your life.
Be proactive about that and get an activity going on the side — preferably one that
doesn’t involve computers. It could be a sport, or music, or cooking, or interior
design. Find something that you’re interested in — and do that on a regular basis.
One thing that helps me is having a hobby that is useful in a practical way. For
example, at least once a week, I like to cook something delicious. It’s easy for me to
keep that up because I need to eat anyway. Plus, this way I’m ensuring that I’m
getting something healthy, which has positive effects back to my work.
Whatever you choose to do, any hobby or side project will give you a sense of
accomplishment that you’re lacking at work. A hobby helps stabilize you so that a
work crisis doesn’t become a life crisis.

Fix 6: Set non-negotiable boundaries
This one is for those who over-compensate when they’re burnt out. As paradox as it
sounds, getting free time can require some discipline, too.
For example, I have a boundary that I do nothing productive — coding or Medium or
whatever — after 9 P.M. I’ve had this boundary for the last five years and I’ve only
crossed it twice.
Not only does it help me wind down, reflect and get a good night’s sleep. It also
gives me something to look forward to during the day. No matter how stressful life is,
I know I’ll always be able to switch my mind off between 9 P.M. and the moment I go
to bed.

Why Your Brain Needs Idle Time
Some vital brain functions demand downtime
elemental.medium.com
The important part is that these boundaries are not flexible. Blocking them out in
your calendar and clearly communicating them with your boss and your colleagues
will help you maintain them.

You might be afraid that you’ll seem lazy. Funnily enough, this is not the case. A
person with clear boundaries makes the impression that they’re in control of their
lives.

Fix 7: Advocate for yourself
This links directly to the above. Clearly communicate what you need — your
boundaries, but also any additional resources, manpower and money that is needed
to achieve the goal of your project.
What you need should be well-reasoned — otherwise, your manager might think
you’re too demanding. But it’s still better to come off as demanding than being too
shy to express what you want. The others can’t read that off the tip of your nose.
Once you start building a habit of expressing what you need, you’ll be surprised at
the number of things that people will do to help you!

Final words: You’re not alone
As I have mentioned earlier, I have yet to meet a programmer who hasn’t
experienced a major period of burnout at some point in their career. So if this article
teaches you one thing, it should be that you’re not an isolated case.
Treat yourself and the others with care, and know that whatever is bringing you down
at the moment, it is not your fault.

9 Hard Lessons I Struggled to Learn During My 18 Years as a Software Developer | by Fernando Doglio | Better
Programming

Here are nine of the best lessons I’ve picked up
during my time as a developer
Photo by Scott Graham on Unsplash.
I started writing code in my bedroom at my parents’ house when I was 14 years old. I
remember reading everything I could get my hands on via my very slow internet
connection. Then when I was 20, I signed my first contract as a web developer,
learning PHP and JavaScript at the time.
And it’s taken me over 18 years in this field to figure out that coding is just a fraction
of our profession. I still enjoy it, mind you. I don’t think I’ll ever stop coding — even if
it is for fun in my spare time — but there is so much more.
That is why I want to share with you my experience and what I think are nine lessons
that developers tend to learn a bit too late in some situations.

1. Leave the Ego at the Door
Developers have huge egos. That’s a fact.
Why, though? I would argue that anyone who takes our profession seriously would
consider themselves to be somewhat of an artist. Yes, we might not be singing in
front of millions of people or painting the Mona Lisa, but we’re sometimes writing
code that solves very complex problems in such an elegant and efficient way that we
can’t help but be proud of our work.
I would argue that a developer is just as much of an artist as a mathematician is
through the way they solve their problems.
Because of this, we tend to crawl around our code — just like a mama bear looking
after her offspring. We made it, we love it, and we can’t stand when people start
arguing about how wrong it may or may not be.
Then again, this is not helping anyone. We love our work, but we need to understand
that we’re solving problems. By discussing our ideas and our solutions with others,
better alternatives might arise. There is nothing wrong with that. In fact, cooperation
is normally what yields the best solutions.
I’ve seen all kinds of egos in my time, and I’ve never seen a case where that ego
worked in the developer’s favor.
So my advice here? Leave the ego at the door the minute you start working as a dev.
Just swallow it and hear what others have to say about your work. Accept that better

ideas might come from outside your head and that they will only help you improve
your skills. You can only win if you listen to feedback.

2. Languages Are Tools. If You Only Know
JavaScript, All Problems Will Look Like
Nails
Stop calling yourself a Java developer or JavaScript developer. Yes, there might be
languages that you favor because you like their features or syntax. That’s perfectly
normal.
However, you’d benefit hugely if you were to learn something else for a while.
Learning new languages — especially if they follow a different paradigm than the
one you’re used to working with — will help you open up your mind to different ways
of solving problems.
I can’t stress this enough: Learning multiple languages and using them for a while is
going to benefit your skills. I read this book called Seven Languages in Seven
Weeks several years ago and it opened up my mind to so many options just because
it showed me the types of options available out there. Options I had never even
considered because I was so focused on my daily tasks and daily tools that I never
stopped to look anywhere else.
We’re developers. We know how to solve problems through code. Don’t put yourself
inside a box. You’ll be limited by the size of that box. Look outside of it, think outside
that box, check out other options, other languages, other ways of solving problems.
Even if it’s for a little while, you’ll come back to your weapon of choice with fresh
ideas and a bigger mindset.

3. It’s Not About Memorizing Algorithms,
It’s About Knowing How to Google Them
Fast Enough
Sometimes new developers think they need to know everything by heart, so they
start feeling bad the minute they realize they start forgetting how to write a simple
for statement.
This is not only normal, but I would argue it’s also healthy.

There is simply too much out there to have it memorized. We don’t need to either.
We need to embrace the fact that the internet is just another tool in our arsenal. Just
like we need our IDE, we need internet access to look for answers.
We all do it, and if you’re just starting out and feeling bad about it, don’t waste time
on that feeling. Just search for your answer and figure out your problem.
Think about it this way: Every language will have a similar yet slightly different way of
implementing the Observer pattern. What do you think is more realistic?
Understanding what the Observer pattern is good for and what kind of problems it
solves or remembering how to implement it in every language you work with?
If you know it’ll solve your problem, then you literally solved your problem. The rest is
just a matter of Googling the best way to implement it. That is not taking any credit
away from your work or from your experience.
And the same goes for every other search you do. Just focus on the important,
problem-solving side of our profession and let Google jog your memory. That’s what
it’s there for.

4. You’ll Be Learning Your Entire Career
Or rather “You should be learning your entire career.” It’s really up to you to decide
whether or not you stay up to date with the latest developments in our industry. But if
you want to stay relevant, then you’ll have to do it.
Technology evolves, languages evolve, and that’s completely normal. Granted, some
ecosystems change faster than others and keeping up with them might seem like a
titanic task. But focus on the important things, remember that you’re just a person
and you can’t know everything. So if you have to learn one thing, my suggestion
would be to learn how to learn.
I know it sounds silly, but that’s probably the #1 skill a developer needs. We have to
get better at learning new skills fast. Otherwise, you run into the risk of being labeled
as obsolete.
And here is where some of the other lessons in this article come into play. Variation,
change, new challenges, no egos — those are all things that will help you learn and
broaden the spectrum of your skillset. The more you do it, the better you’ll get at it.
Eventually, you’ll realize all languages are similar. You’ll start seeing their common
roots and you’ll be able to work with any of them. All you’ll have to do is read up on a
few key things.
You’ll be learning your entire career about:
9 Hard Lessons I Struggled to Learn During My 18 Years as a Software Developer | by Fernando Doglio | Better
Programming

New languages
New (and old) programming paradigms
New ways of working
New ways of solving problems
New ways of interacting with your teammates
New ways of reviewing and testing your code
If you’re not ready to be the eternal student, consider if this is the career for you.
Mind you, I don’t mean “Quit right now,” but rather consider if you’d be willing to open
up your mind to be always learning.

5. Working Is Better Than Perfect
As a manager, I’ve heard myself say this too many times. But as developers, we
tend to think our code needs to be perfect before release. And that’s not only untrue
but potentially a problem.
Early optimization is an issue because you end up spending a lot of time and effort
on something that perhaps doesn’t need to be optimized. And in some situations,
when performing that optimization, you make assumptions that break the feature.
So focus on the work it needs to do and the problem you’re trying to solve. Once it’s
fixed, test it out, iterate over the results, and see what your team thinks about your
solution — even if you can already see ways to improve it. If you’re going to take two
more days just to have it perfect, but it could go to production right now, chances are
it should be in production right now.
At the end of the day, you’re solving a problem. The faster you solve it, the better it’ll
be for your users.

6. Make It Work, Then Optimize
In line with some of the previous points, don’t fall into the early optimization black
hole.
Even if you think you’ll do it quickly, once you come out of it — if ever — you’ll realize
the time dilation effect is real.
Your first task as a software developer writing a new feature or fixing a bug is to
make it work — no matter how ugly the code might look or how inefficient your
9 Hard Lessons I Struggled to Learn During My 18 Years as a Software Developer | by Fernando Doglio | Better
Programming

5

solution might be. If it works, you’ve just proven it can be done. That’s half the battle
right there.
The second step is to optimize it. This is an optional step. A detail that some people
tend to forget. The time you have available to optimize your code depends on a lot of
variables that sometimes are not under your control. So focus on making it work,
then figure out if you actually have the time to optimize it.
Early optimization means optimizing your code while writing it. This is a dangerous
practice because when we’re optimizing, we’re making assumptions about execution
time, data requirements, memory needs, and other factors that we haven’t yet seen
in action. Any such assumption might be wrong and you’ll end up introducing bugs
into your logic.
Think about the TDD workflow:
1. Write your test to understand everything your feature needs to do (it’ll fail).
2. Write your code to have the test pass.
3. Worry about optimizing your code now.
Step 2 is a must. You first need to worry about passing the test, which translates to
having the feature working. The test doesn’t care about the algorithm you used or if
you used three nested if statements. That comes later, probably as part of a code
review process.

7. The Last 10% of a Project Takes 90% of
the Time
This is especially important if you’re working alone, but teams also suffer from not
having this little math detail correct.
Anyone who has finished a project will tell you the same thing (and honestly, this
doesn’t just apply to our industry): You first rush through a lot of details just to have
to take care of them at the end.
And it’s completely normal. We tend to focus on the big features first, leaving out
smaller details or even known bugs to the end. But they need to be tackled
nonetheless, which is where the extra 90% comes in. The fine work takes time. You
need to test, fix, re-test, write documentation, perform user training, present the final
solution, and more.

Of course, it’ll depend on your context, who your client is, and on a lot of other
factors, but there is always something. So remember: When you think you’re almost
done with your code, you’re probably forgetting about something.

8. If You’re Doing It More Than Once, It
Needs to Be Abstracted
Coding is about abstracting behavior. By abstracting common logic, we can reuse it
in other places, but in the beginning, we sometimes fail to notice the importance of
abstraction.
This is my personal rule of thumb: If I have code repeated in two places, then it’s
going into a function (or a method, a module… you get the idea).
Even if the number two seems low for you, consider that in the future you might find
other places to use that abstracted code. And by moving it into a commonplace right
then, you now have access to it.
Abstraction is about scale. A piece of abstracted logic can be used many times with
minimum effort, while copy-pasting code all over the place — although easy to do —
will require a lot more effort the more you use it. Consider what would happen if you
had to change a piece of logic that was repeated five times across your project due
to a bug. You’d literally have five chances to make a mistake while fixing it.
The same logic can be applied to your day-to-day tasks. If you find yourself doing
something more than once, then it probably can be automated somehow. This is key
to efficiency, so don’t only look for repeating patterns in your code but also in your
actions. If you can automate a task that only takes you ten minutes a day, you’re
saving five hours a month.

9. Side Projects Aren’t a Must, but They Do
Help
Some people say that if you want to be a successful developer, you need to create
side projects. I don’t think that’s true. I personally know a lot of great developers who
only code when they’re working on their 9-5.
And honestly, I admire them. They’re able to be great at what they do while also
enjoying their free time doing other things. There is absolutely nothing wrong with
that.

Programming

However, sometimes you need the extra practice. Sometimes you feel like you’re
falling behind other colleagues. And that is where side projects can help.
I’m not saying to build a new framework that gets used by millions and revolutionizes
the industry. Go for it if you like, but I’m talking about copying others’ projects in
order to learn from them. I’m talking about contributing to other people’s projects by
solving bugs or adding extra features.
You can use side projects to experience aspects of development that you don’t get to
see often. If you’re writing unit tests eight hours a day, maybe consider creating
something from scratch and developing some features. If you’re tired of working
alone, consider contributing to an existing project and experience what’s like to
coordinate your work with others.
You can use side projects to strengthen whatever areas you identify as weak to help
you improve your skills. But again, don’t think you need to work on them or have a
green GitHub activity chart in order to be considered a serious developer. That’s just
silly.

Conclusion
Those are nine of the hardest lessons I’ve learned as a developer over the last 18
years. I hope that by sharing my experience, I was able to shed some light on your
new (or already existing) career.
Do you have any other lessons you’ve learned that you’d like to share? Leave a
comment below. I’d love to learn from you.

My guess is that there isn’t a single developer who doesn’t know what GitHub is or at
least hasn’t taken a look at one of the many repositories available. The wide variety
of projects you’ll find on GitHub make it the perfect place for any developer to
become a better version of themselves.
Since GitHub has over 100 million repositories you’re looking for a needle in a
haystack. That’s exactly why we’ll be going over 10 GitHub repositories that can be
helpful when it comes to self-improvement in this article. This way you’ll be saved
the hassle of finding the right repositories and you can start improving yourself right
after this article.

10 Side Hustles to Make Extra Money As a Software Engineer | by George Field | Better Programming

1

Photo by Chronis Yan on Unsplash
Over the last 10 years of my life, I’ve delved into a huge variety of ventures. Some
have been a success, others not so much — but the result is I’ve learned a lot.
Below, I’ll go over my experience and analyse how you can use your skills as an
engineer to create extra income for yourself.

1. Build an Educational Course
How we learn is changing, and the educational landscape looks far different today
than it did 10 years ago. University education is becoming questionable due to the
vast amount of online content that in a lot of cases provides more value than a very
expensive degree that has no guarantee of a job once completed.

10 Side Hustles to Make Extra Money As a Software Engineer | by George Field | Better Programming

Photo by One zone Studio on Unsplash
It’s far cheaper for a person to spend $500 on several courses that are taught by
people who are an expert in that area, who work in it every day, than a lecturer, who
quite often, has no industry experience.
The result is that there are huge opportunities out there to create paid educational
content in the form of courses and subscription-based businesses. Even more
impressive is that this is an area that’s not impossible to get into because you have
one thing that separates you from everybody else: your personality and potential
teaching style.
People like different styles and personalities and learn better from different teaching
styles. All you have to do is be you, teach, and provide value, and you will make
money from this.
Although it’s more work, I’d recommend building your own platform to sell your
courses as you have more control over pricing, branding, etc., and this is going to be
what really makes you successful.

Examples
Yaroslav Shmarov created a course and launched on Udemy, generating 420 sales
in 100 days. He made some really good points and more reasons to avoid using
platforms such as Udemy.
Hosting courses on Udemy is free, but be ready to sell at $10 and get $2-7
On Udemy, you don’t get access to student emails/phones (so you can’t create
your own community, and you can’t cross-sell well)
Hosting on Udemy is good if your potential audience niche is very big
The only engagement a teacher can have with active students is the Q&A
section of a course
Overall, selling courses on Udemy can be considered passive income with
minimum engagement required after publishing a course

Challenges
Course creation can be a huge earner — demand is high and only growing. The
major issues with course creation are as follows:
Audience: Building an initial audience can be a challenge, but it’s not
impossible. It can be done, easily actually, but it requires a lot of work and

10 Side Hustles to Make Extra Money As a Software Engineer | by George Field | Better Programming

3

consistency in creating free content to provide traffic for your landing page
Course quality is important: It comes as no surprise really, but the quality of
your course will affect the success of it. You have to be prepared to fail with the
first few courses you create; however, if you take your time, are patient, and are
prepared to learn, then you can overcome this and drastically increase your
chances of success.

2. Create a Content Platform/Blog
Creating some kind of content-based website is another opportunity you can exploit
as a developer to make extra income. There are so many areas of computer science
and development that can provide you with a great topic on which to base your
content.
By Dominic Walliman on Flickr
A great example of a self-made content/a blog platform is No CS Degree. It was
created by @petecodes and is hitting monthly recurring revenue of $2,500/month.
The product itself is interviews with people who’ve made it as a developer without a
degree, and that’s it — nothing complicated. It’s also free to sign up to the No CS
Degree email list.
“Where’s money made on these platforms?” I hear you ask. Well it’s made by either
ad revenue from ads placed on the site or from sponsorship deals for ad spots on an
email.

Challenges
Writing content takes up a huge amount of time, as you need to do your
research in order to provide the most value for your readers
Finding a niche — a good niche — will go a long way in helping you. Try to
specialise where you can.
Find sponsors — this can often be solved by reaching out to potential suitors for
your ad spots or by using something like Google AdSense to add ads to your
page
Driving traffic is a common problem when creating anything. Again, it can be
overcome by putting time into building followings on platforms such as Twitter or
by improving your site’s SEO ranking.

3. Create a Forum/Community
Paid forums and communities are an emerging opportunity thanks to the rise of
platforms such as Discord, Patreon, and Discourse. These platforms make it very
easy to set up communities and integrate payments, making it a gold mine of
opportunity.
Image by Priscilla Du Preez on Unsplash
Why does this work? Well, people want to communicate and associate with others
who have similar interests, wants, and needs. Essentially, by building a community,
you’re providing a platform for this to happen.

Some examples
Peter Levels built Nomad List, providing a community for digital nomads. The
business now generates $24,000/month.
Anne-Laure Le Cunff built Ness Labs, a community for healthy entrepreneurs
that generates $9,600/month.
Why not utilise the free, open-source tools mentioned above and begin creating your
own community? You can even code additional functionality that can enable to you
to create some awesome features for potential users and really help as many people
as possible.

Challenges
Community building is extremely challenging but highly rewarding due to the
physiological impacts of something called social proof. In essence, it’s hard to
get the first 100 users into your community, but as the number grows, it become
easier to attract more — as the value is in the community. The trick is to stick
with it.
High engagement levels will be needed from you, using up a lot of your time
Managing the community to avoid spam and to maintain good content within the
community will also be a challenge
Note: Building a community is by far one of the hardest things to do; however, it can
be hugely rewarding. Not only can you make a substantial amount of money (due to
word of mouth), but you can really help a lot of people.

4. Create an E-book
As software engineers, we posses vast amounts of knowledge around tech that a lot
of people want to learn. A great way to pass this information down is in the form of
an e-book.
The good thing about e-books is they can be written reasonably quickly, and if you
pick a topic you’re passionate about, then they can be quite fun to make.
You can use a platform such as Gumroad to host your e-book and handle selling it.
Note: E-books can be a great cash cow you can use to generate money that can be
invested in other ventures/hustles. They’re also a great project that can be worked
on over a couple of months, writing a bit every day.

Examples
“The Good Parts of AWS”: An e-book by Daniel Vassallo and Josh Pschorr,
generated $31,000 in sales, selling over 1,000 copies in the first week alone.
“Maker Minions: 101 Automations for Makers, Side Hustlers, and
Entrepreneurs”: An e-book by Michael Gill made $5,000 and is still growing.

Challenges
Research and planning will take up most of your time
Building an audience (you can go about doing this when you launch — there’s
more flexibility with building e-books, as you can publish on platforms such as
Amazon)
Creating a structure for your book can also be a challenge, but putting some
time into figuring this out is the simple solution

5. Freelancing
Ah, freelancing — possibly one of the most obvious forms of making extra money as
a software engineer. The model is simple: Sell your time for some extra cash.

The good news with freelancing is you can get paid very generously for your time,
especially if you can hook yourself up with a well-funded startup.

10 Side Hustles to Make Extra Money As a Software Engineer | by George Field | Better Programming

The bad news is, unlike most of the other side hustles in this article, it leaves you
without a product at the end. This means you’re limited when it comes to scaling, as
you have a direct relationship with time and money.
However, it gives you a great option to transition into full-time work should you
decide to, and then you can go about turning into an agency if that appeals to you.
Note: I’ve done freelancing myself and found it to be a really awesome way to make
money that can be invested into other things or used to create more freedom with
my time. The trick to it is to find good clients.

Examples
Susanne Peng is a developer and designer who built her dream life through
freelancing — her story makes for a really good read
Glenn Stovall is an app developer who also built his life by using freelancing as a
means to create more freedom.

Challenges
Building client relationships iskey and can be challenging to manage as you
have to maintain good relationships with multiple clients
Creating effective ways to manage your time can be a challenging at first but
becomes much easier after you’ve been doing it for a while
Finding clients is also a major challenge. Places such as Upwork aren’t what
they used to be, and you’ll struggle to get decent clients on there. I would
recommend using LinkedIn as a lead-generation tool (search for tech startups,
and just reach out to people on there).

Ghost Blog Themes
Ghost is a powerful blogging CMS for content creators, entrepreneurs, and
developers. To give some perspective on how much it’s growing, 5,933 writers,
podcasters, and video creators set up sites with Ghost to publish online and deliver
newsletters to their audience during this week alone.

I use Ghost myself, as it’s such a powerful platform, and there are some beautiful
themes for it. The great news for you, though, is that there’s a huge shortage of
supply for themes as well — recent posts in the Ghost forum only confirm this.

10 Side Hustles to Make Extra Money As a Software Engineer | by George Field | Better Programming

This provides a golden opportunity to build themes for Ghost, where the average
theme retails for $59 on Ghost’s official website. Ghost themes are built using the
following stack:
Node.js
SQL
Handlebars.js
This article on Geekinsta is a great guide that’ll get you on your way.

Examples
fueko: A small company that sells various themes. They have a Ghost theme
that launched on July 6. The theme they’ve launched retails at $59, and they’ve
sold 94 copies in the last three months, netting $5,546.

Challenges
There’s a lot of support on the Ghost forums, but finding useful tutorial videos
and third-party documentation may be a challenge. The good news is if you
understand Handlebars and Node, then you should be set up for success.
Picking a niche for your theme can help you create a theme a particular
audience will love and will potentially increase your sales. It can be a challenge,
but this is a relatively uncrowded marketplace.
Themes retail, on average, between $29-$99. This means there’s an expectation
on price, resulting in a potential price cap. However, if you create an exceptional
theme, there’s plenty of scope to charge a higher fee for it.

7. The Shopify App
With recent trends in drop shipping, lifestyle businesses, and a push for independent
retail-based outlets to move online, Shopify has opened up another wonderful
opportunity for us developers.
Photo by Roberto Cortese on Unsplash
The Shopify App Store is widely popular among Shopify store owners, as it provides
a place for users to improve their customers experience and helps to increase the
revenue of their business.

These apps can be an excellent source of passive income, as they tend to take care
of themselves — of course, that’s not always the case, but it can still be a great
income builder nonetheless.

Examples
Filippo Mursia has built Tailry, a Shopify app that helps users manage their
stores and inventory. It’s currently generating $2,800/month in revenue and is a
great example of how you can build an app on Shopify’s platfrom and turn it into
a profitable side hustle.

Challenges
Handling ongoing updates once you’ve built the app can be a possible challenge
that’ll need to be managed. There are ways to make this a graceful process, but
it’s definitely worth investigating before diving into Shopify app building.

8. Build an API as a Service
We live in a data-driven age where information, attention, and content are king — to
give you some perspective, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created each day.
Image by Luca Bravo on Unsplash
Taking some of this data and turning it into some form of valuable collection can be a
great way to make money. Businesses make data-driven decisions almost every day
and will happily pay for anything that provides value/ increases potential profits.
APIs provide a great platform to allow access to data for various businesses, so why
not create one and charge for the privilege to access it?
You could create a web scraper that gathers useful data and then a Rest/GraphQLbased API to sit over the top of the data, providing access to it.
If you need inspiration, any kind of marketing-, social-, or product-related data can
be of huge value to a lot of people. Amazon, eBay, and other e-commerce platforms
can also be a great place to gather insights from. These are useful data sets for ecommerce entrepreneurs to analyse.

Examples
Gareth Fuller built a really simple oil-price API that generates $370/month in
revenue. Not bad considering how young a company it is and the room for

10 Side Hustles to Make Extra Money As a Software Engineer | by George Field | Better Programming

9

growth.
Sébastien Dumont built a WordPress-related API that handles front-end
WooComerce. It currently makes $900/month and is growing, with 20,000
downloads.

Challenges
Building a data set can take a lot of research before implementing any solution.
This is because you first need to find how it can provide value and what the best
shape to provide the data in is. There’s a really good article by Coding VC that
provides great insights into how to overcome this challenge, though, and gives
some great tips, too.

9. Become an Online Instructor
There’s no shortage of supply when it comes to people trying to make it as a
software engineer in 2020, so why not jump on the trend and help them by becoming
an online instructor?
I’ve done this myself in the past, and it does provide a decent amount of money. You
can generally charge between $50-$130/hour, depending on what you’re teaching,
and it can be a great way to make some extra income while providing a lot of value
to somebody who may need it.
Platforms like Codementor are providing a great service for matching mentors with
students, and it’s becoming increasingly easier to find people on social media who
are looking for tutors.

Examples
Suresh Atta is a software engineer who’s racked up a total of 1,781 sessions at
$60/hour on Codementor

Challenges
It can be slightly harder to gather momentum because you’ll need to do around
10 sessions to provide social proof to others (I found offering a lot of value and
providing a free 15-minute session managed to help me get some traction with
it).

10 Side Hustles to Make Extra Money As a Software Engineer | by George Field | Better Programming

Competition is high, and this can be a stumbling block, especially when people
can afford to lower their asking price per hour. Personally, I’d use these platforms
as a means to build an audience off of — the platforms will try to prevent you,
but there are often ways around it.

10. Build a Boilerplate Code Base
Think about the amount of times that you’ve gone to start a project, forgetting the
amount of time it takes to set everything up. This is a problem that tons of engineers
have, and we all like quick solutions — so much so that sometimes we’re even
prepared to pay for a simple solution that’s already set up.
Image by Luke Chesser on Unsplash
Building a boilerplate that covers all of the basics of a particular setup can provide
immense value for us software developers, and using a paid-for boilerplate, allows
us to work on the important parts rather than focusing on the setup.
A really good place to build a boilerplate right now is in the world of web apps.
Building a React/Vue UI and coupling it with a Node back end that takes care of
authentication, databases, configuration, and common API services such as
Firebase, SendGrid, Twilio can be a great way to get your foot in the door and enter
the realm of passive income.

Examples
Kyle Gawley built Gravity, a React and Node SAAS boilerplate that generates
$3,700/month in MRR. Kyle has built a really simple, clean UI that’s coupled with
an elegantly designed back end, ready for you to configure it with what ever
database you prefer.

Challenges
Creating a clean UI will be a time-consuming process, but anything worth doing
takes time and requires patience
Creating trust with other developers is hard— although this can be worked
around if you market it from the angle of being a developer yourself
Creating good documentation is another large piece of work that you may want
to keep in mind

Conclusion
There are so many ways you can make money online nowadays, especially being a
developer — it’s basically a superpower and a gateway to financial freedom if
leveraged correctly. I hope you have a wonderful day, and thank you for taking the

Rule of 3.
Is a code refactoring rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should
be replaced by a new code/procedures/methods.

It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once,
but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should
be extracted into a new procedure.
The main concept is to make code/procedures/methods generic so it can be reused
in many places.

Consistency is king
Being consistent with the structure and how you code things. This can help with the
readability & maintainability of your application.
Try and come up with coding standards, that help with consistency. It should be as
little as the naming conventions of your variables. Another big one is the structure of
the application, it should be obvious where the developer needs to make changes or
add something new.

Reduce nesting
An if within if can get messy and very hard to read, very quickly. Sometimes you
may not be able to get around this but always have a look at the structure of your
code.
This is also the same for
code harder to read.

else if

. Avoid if possible as this can sometimes make the

A guard clause is an effective way to help with this!

A guard clause is simply a check that immediately exits the
function, either with a return statement or an exception.
Without a guard clause:

if (account != null)
{
if (order != null)
{
if (order.term == Term.Annually)
{
// term annually
}
else if (order.term == Term.Monthly)
{
// term monthly
}
else
{
throw new InvalidEnumArgumentException(nameof(term));
}
}
else
{
throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(subscription));
}
}

With a guard clause:
if (account == null)
{
throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(account));
}if (order == null)
{
throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(order));
}if (order.term == Term.Annually)
{
// term annually (return here)
}if (order.term == Term.Monthly)
{
// term monthly (return here)
}

Think of the bigger picture
Understanding the bigger picture is very important this then makes the smaller detail
easier to follow. Once you understand the bigger picture, the little detail won’t take
you too long to figure out.

Spend time thinking of naming things

19 things I stole from great developers | by Daniel Anderson | JavaScript in Plain English

4

Naming things in coding is one of the hardest things you can do. This can be naming
a class, method or even a variable.
The great developers take their time thinking of relevant names as they know this
helps with readability!

Technical debt is bad
Overestimating can help with this. Write it best as you can once otherwise you will
have to come back to it over and over again.

Technical debt is a concept in software development that reflects
the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy
(limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that
would take longer

Overestimate
Might be a strange one and depending on what department you work in you may not
like this point but you will see the great developers overestimate tasks as they know
things always take longer then you expect and an adding a buffer to the estimate can
really help you get things right.
This can really help with the above point “Technical debt is bad”. if you
underestimate or estimate a time which is only considering the happy path this can
actually create technical debt as you will only have time to make it work rather then
making the code clean and easy to maintain.

Documentation and code comments
They help to preserve context and share knowledge. You will hear the more
experienced keep saying can we document that process or fail code reviews as
there no comments on things like interfaces.

Be confident about deleting bad code
You will see a lot the less confident developers comment out massive blocks of code
and leave them there. Version control is there for a purpose! The great developers
don't shy away from deleting the bad parts of the application.

Spend time on code Reviews
19 things I stole from great developers | by Daniel Anderson | JavaScript in Plain English

5

The good developers will spend longer on code reviews and know the importance of
code reviews.
Help find bugs early
Improves developers skills and getting the rest of the team into good practices.
Sharing knowledge
Consistent design and implementation
The best code review process I’ve seen a great developer enforce is:
A Small task with little risk should be reviewed by 1 developer at their desks.
A medium-sized/large change or a risky change should be reviewed by 3
developers one of them being a senior developer at their desks.
An extremely risky change or a new part of the application being
developed should have a meeting booked and 3 developers at least one of
them being a lead developer going through each line together and making
points.

Write good tests
You will notice the more experienced and stronger developers take more time on
writing good tests.
Having good tests help you scale your application with more confidence and help
reduce production bugs.

Spend time designing
Before they dive into the code they have a think through and break it down into small
chunks. This helps them be more prepared on how everything fits together and
create cleaner code.

Focus on the fundamentals and not on the syntax
This is a big one! They like to learn the fundamentals over-focusing on syntax. This
helps them find problems more effectively. This can also help them google issues
with more understanding.

Make Google your best friend

19 things I stole from great developers | by Daniel Anderson | JavaScript in Plain English

6

They are experts at Googling to help them solves their problems. This help because
of the above point “Focus on the fundamentals and not on the syntax”.
Because they’ve focused on the fundamentals they know what Google terms to
search. This is difficult to do if you’ve obsessed with learning the syntax!

Make sure it works first, then make it pretty later
You see this a lot with the weaker developers they seem to spend so much time
making it look pretty at the start and then find out later how they have coded won't
work.
The great developers get a happy path working earlier on. Helping them to identify
any issues early on before they make it pretty. This can help projects go a lot more
smoothly.

Risk management and problem resolution
Senior developers can define risks, can distil complex problems through the
application of design patterns and can independently solve different issues due to
past experience.

Ask questions
Great developers want to know everything. They don't mind asking questions even if
they might sound extremely simple. These can be technical or business-related
questions.
Understanding the business needs helps them create better code! They are not
scared of asking questions as they’re confident in their ability.

Keep logic out of the database whenever possible
This point comes down to the type of your application you’re building and only if it's
not going to affect performance.
They know to keep their database queries to simple CRUD operations.

Create, read (aka retrieve), update, and delete
Then the business logic layer should pull this all together. This helps developers
know where to look for business logic. This can get messy very quickly if you have
logic in database queries and in the code!

19 things I stole from great developers | by Daniel Anderson | JavaScript in Plain English

7

KISS
Keep It simple Stupid
They know keeping the code simple is the best thing to do. Even if that means
sometimes creating more lines of codes. You will see a lot of the weaker developers
create one-liners like below.
return dir.Keys.Any(k => k >= limit) ? dir.First(x => x.Key >= limit).Value : dir[dir.
Keys.Max()];

This often works but reading this is extremely hard!

Conclusion
This is what I see great developers do day to day. You will see a lot of them are not
to do with the actual coding but process’s and how they approach tasks. I’m sure
there is a lot more to add to this list. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading!

A list of lessons to make you a better developer
quickly
50 Things I Wish I Learned Earlier as a Developer | by Piero Borrelli | JavaScript in Plain English

Photo by John Schnobrich on Unsplash
Lately, I posted an article explaining how to fight your frustration and self-doubt as a
developer. However, once I was done, I realized how many more lessons, apart from
the ones shared in that piece, I had to learn the hard way.
The following is a series of that. Lessons, habits, and things I wish I learned
earlier in my career. Once learned and internalized, they will be able to save you
time, effort, and frustration in the long run.

“Growing means to leave stuff behind. The burdens and weights,
the things that make it hard for you to truly fly and be the best
you can”

Lessons
Never think you will know everything about anything. Programming languages,
algorithms, and software development, in general, is too vast to know in its
entirety. Save yourself time and frustration by recognizing you will never know
something completely.
Don’t beat yourself up if you don’t understand a new concept instantly.
Information needs to be processed in your brain. Give a bird-eye to the
concept and then come back later, over time, and iteratively to truly master it.
If your brain is burning and you have been stuck in front of a problem for hours,
take a break from the computer and come back later with a fresh mind.
Don’t compare yourself to other professionals around you. Use them to
understand your position, but recognize the uniqueness of your path and use
yourself, your desires, and strengths as a platform to grow.
Become proficient and go deep with your knowledge in at least one
programming language.
Learn shortcuts, tips, and tricks regarding your IDE of choice. It will save you an
incredible amount of time
Check your code 10, 100, 10000 times before opening a pull request
Have a plan to prepare yourself for smart working when necessary during these
times
Learn how to use Google as your best friend to find solutions online

Never underestimate the importance of the stack trace when debugging errors
Workout, even every day if possible. Sitting in front of a computer for hours is
incredibly unhealthy and you need to cope with that
Be picky when you can about your next company. You always deserve the best,
and a place that will make you grow as a professional
Never settle for something that doesn’t respect certain standards of quality
Never push untested code
Don’t be afraid to ask your seniors for help
Before asking for help, try 100 times to solve the problem by yourself, that’s
when you will learn the most
Never stop learning new things
Don’t take corrections and critiques to your code personally
Dedicate time outside of your daily job to improve your career
Try to learn a new concept every day
Always seek for tasks that put you out of your comfort zone, since that’s when
you’re growing the most
Discover all the hidden powers and things you can do with the Chrome
developer’s tools
Take some time away from the keyboard once in a while
Deeply think about the problem and a solution before writing code
Have in mind how you will test each piece of code before you even write it
Always use a linter to uniform your code
Adopt a coding style and adopt it consistently in your code
Refactor more than one time, to truly get to the best solution
Stop binge-watching tutorials and start your projects
Create your personal brand and authority online
Master soft skills to become a true professional
Always respect other people’s ideas
Express your idea without diminishing other people’s ones

Take action now, don’t wait for willingness to come from the sky and hit you in
the head
If you have time, blog about what you’re learning. Teaching is an incredible way
to learn something better yourself
Get a developer’s profile on Twitter and share your ideas
Try to work on something meaningful and of impact, that will help others and
possibly make their life better
That was it for this article. As always, thanks for reading and keep new ideas and
comments flowing in the section below.

Find Your Element
by Ken Robinson
· Expose yourself to as many new opportunities as possible to discover your
unrealized aptitudes.
· Strive to have a growth mindset. It will allow you to develop and improve your
abilities.
· Find your passions, things you do without noticing the passage of time.
· Forge your own path, along with an understanding of your happiness, instead of
blindly seeking wealth, immediate gratification, or other people’s definitions of
happiness.
· Don’t plan your life when you’re young because life is unpredictable.
· Don’t assume you are bad at something because you performed poorly in that
subject in school. Standardized tests only measure one kind of human intelligence
and schools only cater to a few learning styles.
· Every person is special and different because of their genetic makeup (every
human who ever existed in history has their own genes) and their environment
(everyone has their unique mix of family, friends, and location).
· If you accept you can’t predict or control the future, you will discover many new
opportunities.
· Experiencing positive emotions from your passion reduces stress, chronic pain,
and addictions. It also improves sleep and concentration.

· Finding a group of people who share your passion can be very beneficial, or even
necessary, for both you and other members of the group to realize personal goals.

Start With Why
by Simon Sinek
· Think inside out (starting with why), not outside in (starting with what).
Communicate the why as it fosters a sense of belonging.
· The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe.
· People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it. What you do simply proves
what you believe.
· Excited employees and customers who believe in your cause are the most powerful
resources an organization can have.
· Financial incentives or punishments do not motivate people on a deep and
emotional level.
· Customer manipulation may work in the short term, but it doesn’t foster trust and is
ultimately counterproductive.
· The Golden Circle consists of three concentric circles. The what is the outer layer,
the how is middle layer, and the why is the core.
· Making profit is a result of the what and the how, not the why.
· The Law of Diffusion on innovation breaks down to 2.5% innovators, 13.5% early
adapters, 34% early majority, 34% late majority and 16% laggards. If you want mass-

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

market success, you have to achieve a 15–18% tipping point.
· The early majority won’t accept something until early adapters have tried it and
accepted it, and you won’t get early adapters until they believe in what you have.

Purple Cow
by Seth Godin
· Take risks at being remarkable, and don’t worry about criticism.
· Target the people who are both willing to try new things and very vocal at spreading
the word to others.
· Invent the product with marketing.
· Target and measure your marketing effectively.
· Don’t emulate the leader, because you’ll never learn the process of turning risks
into success.
· The traditional form of advertising is no longer effective because in today’s
overwhelmingly advertised world capturing the consumer’s attention is almost
impossible.
· In today’s crowded marketplace, there is no room for “ordinary.”
· Being ridiculed can be a good thing, as it spreads word about you and your
product.

Tipping Point
by Malcolm Gladwell
· To spread an idea, you must make sure it sticks first. It has to be something
special, catchy, unique, and remarkable to cut through the market noise.
· Keep the group smaller than 150 if the goal is to effectively spread a message.
· The spread of ideas is similar in behavior to the spread of epidemics.
· The tipping point is when ideas spread from an initial niche user base into the mass
majority.
· A select few types of people are generally responsible for ideas to spread:
connectors, salesmen, and mavens.
· External elements influence our behavior. Such influence is generally greater than
what we perceive it to be.
· Small changes in context caused by external elements can have a big ripple effect.

Getting Things Done
by David Allen
· Focus. When other thoughts enter the mind, record them on an external nearby
Thought Bucket.
· Empty the Thought Bucket weekly and organize it.
· Remove unimportant items, finish 2-minute tasks, and enter deadlines, or
appointments in your calendar.
· Practice outcome thinking by having a project list that tracks steps leading to
desired goals. The most urgent step on the project list goes to the Next Action list.
· The Next Action list should stay with you at all times so you can choose to act on
them when time frees up.
· The Waiting For list can help expedite things.
· The Tickler File consists of 31 days and 12 months into the future, and is for time
sensitive reminders.
· The Someday/Maybe list is for ideas in the future that are not concrete projects yet.
· Set up a functional workplace to create a cockpit of control that eases your mind.
· Review and update all of your lists weekly.
· Natural planning turns ambiguous ideas into brainstorming sessions that reduce
the fog and provide clarity into actionable steps.
· Don’t multi-task. Focus 100% of your mental capacity on the task at hand.

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

· Our brain’s nature is to think. Thus, thoughts might enter our mind that distract us
from the current tasks.
· Daily to-do lists are inefficient because of their warped view of time.

The Seven Habits of Highly Effective
People
by Stephen Covey
· Effectively integrating into the world means aligning personal paradigms with
universal principles.
· “Sharpen the Saw” to stay effective. Stay physically fit by exercising. Stay mentally
healthy by learning new things. Stay socially and emotionally engaged by developing
positive relationships. Maintain spiritual health by confronting and reflecting on your
own values.
· Be proactive and take control of your own fate.
· Begin with the end in mind and set long term goals with an understanding of your
personal mission statement.
· Visualize the outcome of every step toward your goal so it will be easier to translate
into concrete actions.
· “Put First Things First” by prioritizing things that bring you toward your goals and
are consistent with your values or norms.

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

8

· Practice the Win-Win mentality. It will create good relationships, mutual trust, and
long term benefits.
· Forming stable relationships means listening empathetically to others and
understanding their personal paradigms so you can contribute and invest in their
goals.
· Engage in active listening by repeating back people’s own words, mirroring their
emotions, and helping structure their thought processes.
· Synergize with others by cooperating openly and respectfully. Collectives can
achieve a result that is impossible for an individual.
· Don’t say yes to everything.
· Don’t view the world from a Win-Lose, competitive perspective.
· To change, you have to address your character, not your behavior.
· Our paradigms are our subjective perception of the world that shapes our habits.
· If you want to be able to influence others, first seek to understand. Only then can
you be understood.

The 4-Hour Workweek
by Tim Ferriss
· Aim high so you can create your own reality and write your own rules.
· Step outside of your comfort zone and take action now.
· Try to gain the freedom of remote working within your current job.

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

9

· Be effective on the job by working on things with the goal of gaining remote work.
· The 80/20 rule applies with work: 20% of work will bring 80% of results. So, focus
on being productive instead of busy.
· Time is money. Remove things that reduce your effectiveness at the job.
· Rate the importance of a task by asking yourself, “If this is the only thing I do today,
would I be happy with today?”
· Finish your high priority items before noon.
· Address email and voicemail messages after completing the high priority tasks are
done. Then bundle tasks to finish them.
· Have others play by your communication rules.
· Set up an automatic source of income by outsourcing everything. The key is to use
as little of your time as possible.
· Have open communication and do not let your input be a requirement in the
business process.
· Delegate as much responsibility as possible.
· Validate and test your products before selling. Set up an online store with out-ofstock items and an A/B testing ad campaign.
· Establish credibility in your product category.
· Appear bigger; because people trust larger companies.
· Be picky about your customers. The 20/80 rule applies. Top 20% of your customers
will be responsible for 80% of revenue, so attend to them.
· Go premium with your product because premium quality brings higher profit and
customer quality.
· Don’t lie to yourself and think that when staying within your comfort zone, things will
magically be okay.
· Don’t start your day by checking emails.
· A fulfilling life can be achieved by being mobile and flexible. This means that you
can do whatever you like, whenever you like.
· Moderate, automatic income you can manage anywhere around the world allows
for the mobility required for the lifestyle you truly want.
· The worst-case scenario from making a decision is usually not as bad as you think.

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

10

· Five steps to independence: 1) start with a full time 9–5 job; 2) move to a full time
remote 9–5 job; 3) gain efficiency to reduce 9–5 tasks to 9–1; 4) use other time to
automate alternative income; 5) quit old job and live on alternative income.

The Innovator’s Dilemma
by Clayton Christensen
· Have two innovation incubation models for an established firm.
· Observe how customers are actually using the product.
· Have discovery-driven planning that is adaptable to various factors of change.
· Be creative at finding the right customers who can directly benefit from your
innovation, rather than a large, less targeted market.
· Expect trial and error so that a new organization can fail early and without great
expense.
· Don’t develop products and services based on what customers say they would like.
· Don’t innovate in a singular quality such as performance oversupply. What does
innovation look like in functionality, reliability, convenience, and price?
· Established and entrant firms bring different types of innovations to market.
· Established firms bring sustaining innovations to maintain market positions and
profit margins. However, they still lose market dominance because of their focus on
sustaining profits while ignoring new markets brought by disruptive technologies.

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

11

· Knowing what customers want through surveys, focus groups, and interviews is
good at incremental improvement, but not effective at creating the next thing.
· A tunnel-vision chasing of profit margin should be moderated with long term
expectations.
· The difficulty of predicting emerging markets means an established company can’t
justify the investment. Consequently, they usually miss out on disruptive
technologies and the emerging market that comes with it.
· Sometimes firms are too inflexible with its Resources/Processes/Values (RPV)
framework to adapt to changing conditions.
· Theoretical models for innovation rarely work in the real world.
· Disruptive innovations are usually variations on existing technologies that open up
a new customer base.
· The best way for an established company to take advantage of a disruptive
technology is to create or acquire an organization that is small but utilizes flexible
processes.

The Lean Startup
by Eric Ries
· Focus the whole team on finding a sustainable business model. The faster the
model is found, the likelier the start-up is to succeed.
· Learn through a scientific approach, constantly validating your findings.

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

12

· Validate your hypotheses by speaking with real customers.
· Move from believing to knowing by testing the value and growth hypotheses of your
product.
· Test the demand of your product by building a minimal viable product.
· Establishing the build-measure-learn cycle as fast as possible will get you to your
sustainable business model quickly.
· Split-test all your features to distinguish what would be valuable to your customers
and what would be a waste of time.
· Pick an engine of growth (sticky, viral, or paid) and focus.
· You must examine the right metric, not superficial metrics that don’t help you
towards your goal.
· Traditional strategies cannot manage start-ups because start-ups lack a history.
· Don’t be afraid of pivoting your fundamental core assumptions.
· The main goal for a start-up is to find and build a sustainable business model.
· Value hypothesis assumes early adopters will accept a product.
· Growth hypothesis assumes a product will appeal to a larger group of people later.

Zero to One
by Peter Thiel

131 Actionable Ideas from Ten Books I Wish I Had Read Ages Ago | by Louis Tsai | Mission.org | Medium

13

· Think about the future as a definitive vision. This is a vision you want to focus on
and attain.
· When thinking about the future, think about the progress which stands between
now and the future.
· Finding ideas most people don’t know about, or agree with, is key to being
successful.
· First aim to be a profitable monopoly at a specific and narrowly defined target
market, then expand to other markets.
· The initial team members are critical. You must find the right mix of skills, vision,
and personal connections with each other. This makes it easier to foster a strong
company culture.
· Have balanced owner interests to avoid future misalignments that may cause the
company to suffer.
· Two types of progress bridge the now and the future: horizontal progress (one to n)
and vertical progress (zero to one).
· Vertical progress is hard because it does not exist yet. It requires you to see the
present differently. It also requires you to find a truth most people don’t see or agree
with.
· A startup has only one specific future vision leading to success. One must parse
decisions relevant to specific conditions.
· Perfect competition is good for consumers, but it does not drive progress.
· Real progress, the zero to one type of vertical progress, usually results in
monopolies. That means you’re producing something much better than everyone
else is.
· Sales and distribution is vital because your products will never sell themselves.
Optimize your sales effort per distribution point to include various sales strategies.
· Founders tend to be strange people. However, the vision they have is
indispensable because the decisions are made to realize that original vision.

Ter domínio sobre as linguagens de programação é importante para a
sua carreira, mas você sabia que fazer networking pode te ajudar a ter
mais oportunidades?
Desenvolvedor pode ser uma profissão muito introspectiva, apesar de
estar sempre em contato com o seu time, mas você precisa quebrar essa
bolha.
Frequente eventos físicos ou online de assuntos que te interessam, veja

A New Way to Schedule Your Work Week | Forge

1

Back when “going home” was a thing we did after work, most teams had some sort
of group norm for when was acceptable to shut down for the day. Maybe around 5
p.m., people started leaving, and the majority departed by 6 p.m., with a bump
around the time the boss went out the door.
With millions of people working from home for the first time in the wake of Covid-19,
though, those norms are now less clear. If people aren’t commuting, the workday
theoretically never has to end, though, of course, it should. But there’s an approach
beyond counting hours to determine when you’ve put in an honest day’s labor — and
I think it’s ultimately more effective than watching the clock in any scenario.
When I first began working for myself and from home years ago, I immediately
realized that I rarely felt fully “off.” There was nothing stopping me from watching TV
all day, but the more common issue was that I would half work and half not work until
it was time to sleep. There was always something I could be doing, so I felt guilty if I
was in my apartment but I wasn’t doing it. This experience is common, according to
a JDP survey of Americans who are newly working from home. And 66% of
respondents said they are more likely to work nights and weekends than before.
Eventually, I learned how to effectively divide the workday into time on and time off:
short, focused daily to-do lists. Some items were concrete tasks (“write draft of
column for Medium”), some were more open-ended (come up with new article ideas,
think about a new introduction for a book proposal), and some were administrative
(“email triage” was a frequent one), but whenever something went on the list, it was
a guarantee to myself that I would do it before quitting time.
Once I had my list for the day, I figured out when, roughly, I would tackle each item,
based around what productivity guru David Allen calls the “hard landscape” of the
day (appointments for specific times). Once I made it through the list, I could be
done. Sometimes that would happen at 2 p.m. or 7 p.m., although 5 p.m. was more
frequent.
Over time, I started getting a good sense of how many tasks would fit in eight hours.
Still, if the list was chosen well, reaching the end of it felt like a good day no matter
what time it was.
Granted, running my own business means I have more control over my time than
most. But I have studied how other organizations work, and as much as you can
make it work, I think managing by task, not time, is the superior approach. You can
create solid priority lists for any given week, which can then be broken down into
task lists for each day. There’s no need to micromanage yourself.

Even if time isn’t the key measure of productivity, it’s also fine to expect that a day’s
tasks will take about seven to eight hours. A one-hour day will leave people bored,
and a 13-hour day will leave people exhausted. Best to aim somewhere in the
middle.
But in the absence of group time norms, daily task lists give you permission to stop
work. You can relax in the evening or on the weekend knowing you’ve met
expectations — even if you can still see your workspace while watching TV.
Focused task lists are also more efficient. People can waste eight hours sitting in
their chairs at an office, doing little of consequence, but feeling okay because they’re
physically there. Managing by task, not time, means focusing on results. If people
stop work some days at 3 p.m., that’s fine — there’s no ambiguity about what was
accomplished, so everybody can be happy about what got done.

A New Way to Schedule Your Work Week | Forge

1

As a time-management consultant, I see a lot of schedules — so I know what I’m
talking about when I say that Catherine Gillespie’s schedule was a work of art.
Gillespie, a strategy consultant, tracked her time for me last year as part of a timemakeover project I recently led. She was freelancing 30–40 hours a week while
homeschooling her five kids — before the pandemic. She exercised in the mornings;
she got together with friends. She made it all work.
So why was she seeking advice from me? She told me that she wanted to protect
time for creative writing in her full life. Her husband was happy to take the kids for a
few hours on Saturdays so she could write. But when work took longer than
expected, or a client asked for a new project, she’d log the extra hours during those
Saturday windows. And just like that, her writing time would be gone.
Her schedule worked when everything went according to plan. But it had to go
according to plan.
It’s a common dilemma. People make time for things that matter to them. Then life
happens, and the time gets taken away. It’s easy to get discouraged, but that’s not
the only option. You can be more optimistic about life if you become more
pessimistic about time. When you plan for what you’ll do when plans go awry, you
increase the chances of making progress toward your goals.

Everything in life needs a back-up slot
In Gillespie’s case, I suggested the option of scheduling in a back-up slot for
additional work, such as one to two designated weekday evenings, so that she
wouldn’t need to use her Saturday time for any lingering tasks.
Other people find success by scheduling a back-up slot for an activity they’re trying
to do. Elizabeth Morphis, a professor, needed to submit a journal article by a June 1
deadline. She planned to work from 6–9 a.m. each day during the week of May 18th
to fit the writing in around her teaching commitments. “But I decided to carve out
additional hours each day of the weekend to work on the manuscript, just in case,”
she says.
By the time the weekend rolled around, she was glad she did. “I needed it,” she
says. “My two-year-old was not sleeping well that week and I was up with her more
than once during the night.” Morphis could only use the 6–9 a.m. slot once, but
instead of panicking over her four lost mornings, she used her designated extra time
and submitted the article ahead of schedule. “Scheduling back-up slots has been
how I have been able to stay productive this summer,” she says.

The back-up approach isn’t just a tactic. It’s a
mindset.
To be sure, designating a back-up slot is not easy in a full schedule. If finding one
chunk of time for research or creative projects or exercise feels challenging, finding
time for two or more — that you hope you won’t need! — might feel impossible.
Consciously leaving extra time open involves trade-offs, often difficult ones.
But good time management means planning a resilient schedule, not a perfect one.
When you schedule one slot a week for something, you only get to it if nothing else
goes wrong. If you schedule an extra slot, then the priority still happens even when
all doesn’t go perfectly. There is a big difference between spending zero time on
something and spending some time. The narrative changes from “I never go to yoga”
to “Hey, in a crazy week I still got to go to a yoga class!”
To achieve that victory, it’s worth a little pessimism on time — assuming something
might go wrong and planning accordingly. It’s a smart calendar strategy, but it’s also
a smart mindset about life. We hope for the best, but design our lives to still work in
other circumstances. Even if a client looks like she’ll confirm a project — meaning
your business makes its numbers for the month — you put out a few other inquiries,
and have another project that could start earlier, just in case. You hope for sun at an
outdoor wedding, but you scout out an indoor plan B as well.
The back-up option doesn’t just keep you from scrambling — it lets you relax about
life in general. When the client says she’ll need more time, you don’t think “How can
you do this to me?” Instead, you can just smile and say “we’re ready when you are!”

Key Takeaways
The software industry has a dismal track record when it comes to predicting and planning
in the face of uncertainty.

Accepting Uncertainty: The Problem of Predictions in Software Engineering | by J. Meadows | Medium

There are significant biases preventing us from learning, including cognitive biases and
compensation structures.
Statistical approaches to predictions can be successful if we expend the effort to create
learning-based models such as Monte Carlo simulations.
Highly uncertain environments are best exploited using the iterative learning models
inherent to Agile methods.
Extremely uncertain, non-deterministic environments are best exploited by the incremental
learning model of hypothesis testing (Hypothesis-Driven Development) and learning to
accept the discomfort associated with uncertainty.

The Best Laid Plans…
“Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.”
This quote is often attributed to physicist Neils Bohr. It’s also variously attributed to one or all of
the following: Mark Twain, Yogi Berra, Samuel Goldwyn, politician Karl Kristian Steincke, or
simply an old Danish proverb. That’s a healthy warning that things are rarely as simple as they
seem, and they usually get more complicated the deeper we go into them. If we can’t even
determine who cautioned us about the difficulty of predictions, perhaps it’s an indicator that
predictions themselves are even trickier.
The software industry operates on predictions at nearly every turn. Yet our track record of
success with them is dismal. Depending on which metrics we choose to quote, between 60–
70% of software projects are delivered over-budget, over-schedule, or canceled outright [1],
often after large amounts of money have been spent.
What causes this, and what can be done to increase the odds of success? Before we get into
that, let’s review the reasons for making software predictions.
Businesses need to budget and plan. Capital, the lifeblood of a business, must be allocated
sensibly toward efforts providing the best return. We need to answer questions such as: How
much should we spend? Which projects get approval to proceed? Over what time horizon are
we allocating? Is it the two weeks of the next sprint or the twelve months of the next fiscal
year?
Traditionally, allocation questions were answered by first creating an estimate of long-range
project scope and cost, formulating a plan around them, and deciding whether the plan was
worthy of capital. For many reasons, some of which we discuss below, a plan often started
failing even before its ink was dry.
With the advent of Agile methods such as Scrum, planning cycles are as short as two weeks.
But even shortened release cycles still result in disappointment at least 60% of the time [1]. So
what’s wrong? Why aren’t we improving things? Why can’t we learn to make things better?

Accepting Uncertainty: The Problem of Predictions in Software Engineering | by J. Meadows | Medium

Why We Don’t Learn
Let’s examine what mechanisms drive us to continue with strategies that often fail and leave
us stuck in a non-learning cycle. If we can understand the motivations for our actions, it might
make it easier to change them and learn something along the way.

We Get Paid Not To
In much of the corporate world, job security and incentives are tied to making accurate
predictions, formulating a plan to achieve them, allocating scarce capital, and delivering on the
plan. Additionally, there are often financial incentives to deliver at less than the predicted cost
and completion date. As long as pay incentives are tied to predicting and planning the future,
predictions and plans will be the bread and butter of business activity, whether they produce
the desired outcome or not. Worse, the incentives often motivate us to see validity in this
activity, regardless of whether it exists.
Unfortunately, the solution to failed predictions is often the alluringly plausible, “We’ll do better
next time.” But it’s natural to wonder: how many attempts does it require to achieve success?
At some point, we should realize a strategy isn’t working, and we should try something else.
What prevents us from realizing this? It’s simple: we’re paid to make predictions, not to
understand the problem with them. Upton Sinclair captured the essence of this when he wrote
(in gender-specific terms):

“It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary
depends on his not understanding it.”
If we want to improve our outcomes, we need to change our compensation structures, so they
reward us for learning and move away from structures rewarding us for not understanding
things.
An anecdote: Once, when describing to an executive how uncertain completion dates are in
non-deterministic systems, he turned to me in exasperation and, holding his thumb and
forefinger a fraction of an inch apart, said, “You’re telling me you don’t know when you will
finish until you are this close to being done? That’s nonsense.” It’s hard to say who was more
disappointed in the conversation. The executive, because to him, I seemed to lack a basic
understanding of how business works, or me, because the executive seemed to lack a basic
understanding of the mathematics of his business. In reality, we were both right, at least from
our respective viewpoints. The real problem lay in the architecture of our compensation system
that drove us to incompatible beliefs.

The Allure Of Simplicity
No matter how we practice it, software engineering is a difficult business undertaking. It was
always thus. Fred Brooks, writing decades ago, concluded there was “No Silver Bullet” [2] that
would eliminate the inherent complexity and difficulty of developing software. And yet here we

Accepting Uncertainty: The Problem of Predictions in Software Engineering | by J. Meadows | Medium

5

are, so many years later, still seeking a solution to the complexity, something that will make it
simple. This desire for simplicity drives us to create over-simplified plans discounting the
likelihood of the unknowns that will derail our project when they suddenly appear, often late in
the plan after considerable sums have been spent.
When it comes to predictions, it’s alluring to believe there’s a universal methodology that
always succeeds when we adhere rigidly to its practices. From there, it’s a short leap to
believing that failure is due to insufficient rigor in applying the methodology, and not the
methodology itself.
Yet history shows us a never-ending parade of methodologies come and go, falling into and
out of fashion with regular occurrence. What this suggests is the software industry deals with
complex problems, and there’s no simple, “Silver Bullet” solution that will solve them. From
that wondrous wit, H.L. Mencken, we have this admonition to warn us about the allure of
simplicity:

“… there is always a well-known solution to every human problem —
neat, plausible, and wrong.”

The Sunk Cost Fallacy
Once we have invested time and money to create a prediction, the sunk cost fallacy rears its
head. The sunk cost fallacy boils down to this: money already spent cannot be recovered, but
we’re often unable to see that and spend additional money seeking a return on our initial
outlay. We’re prone to this because our job security usually requires us to prove we’re making
wise financial decisions that turn out to be profitable. Worse, the more we spend, the more we
feel the need to justify our investment, putting us on a spiraling path of ever greater cost. All of
this means we will too often spend money to defend a failed prediction long after it would be
better abandoned and the money reallocated to a more sensible idea.
There’s an instructive example in the natural world, which has no sunk costs. If something
doesn’t work, if it’s maladaptive to its environment, it’s dealt a swift and pitiless blow that ends
its reign, and a new idea quickly replaces it. It’s an example worth remembering next time we
find ourselves believing our prediction will come true if we just invest a bit more into it.

The Dogma Trap
Any successful business has, deliberately or accidentally, discovered a set of practices
allowing it to exploit a niche in its environment. These practices are codified into a system of
rules and organizational hierarchies intended to perpetuate the success of the business. The
longer the success, the easier it is for these practices to become dogma. If any of these
successful practices involve predictions, then belief in the efficacy of predictions may become
dogma as well.
Of course, the cardinal problem with dogma is that, by definition, it’s unchanging, thereby
blinding us to a changing environment, which has no such definition. And when the

Accepting Uncertainty: The Problem of Predictions in Software Engineering | by J. Meadows | Medium

6

environment changes but the dogma doesn’t, then it’s a short step to extinction. Avoiding this
requires us to reject dogma.
But rejecting dogma is often an unwelcome practice in an organization. Those who question it
often are labeled as someone who “isn’t a team player” or needs to “get with the program.”
Sidelining or removing such people is the typical response. After all, dogma exists in a
business because it codifies a strategy that led to success and protecting that success is a
principal mission of the organization. When it comes to predictions, however, a reasoned
approach suggests thoughtfulness, not dogma, should guide decision making.

The Cruelty Of Randomness
Prediction typically has two troubling beliefs inherent to it. One, the future will proceed much
like the past and, two, all past events were expected. In reality, at the moment they were
occurring, events that reshaped the future were often entirely unexpected. By forecasting the
future, we’re often assuming there will be no unexpected future events. The cognitive trap is
that new endeavors seem to be similar to those in the past, making us believe we have
advance knowledge of events that would otherwise surprise us. But each new endeavor
unfolds according to its own internal, and usually unknowable, set of unique characteristics
whose complexities are revealed to us only after we’re deep in the work. Complex problems,
such as those found in software, never perfectly repeat themselves, no matter how similar they
may seem to prior problems, and no matter how much our wishful thinking tries to make them
so.
If we know what we don’t know, then we can simply apply an appropriate fudge factor to
account for it and proceed on our way, satisfied our plan accounts for unknowns.
Unfortunately, we’re too often unaware of our own ignorance, much less how to plan for it.
Additionally, we’re incentivized to find reasons it “failed last time because of X, but we have
accounted for that this time.” While we may have accounted for X in the latest prediction, it’s
never X that surprises us the next time. It’s Y or Z or any other unknown. While there are a
finite number of alphabetic characters such that we can eventually account for all of them,
there’s no such upper limit in the possible range of real-world unknowns.
But what if we get lucky and are rewarded with a random success for one of our predictions? If
we don’t realize it’s random, it will inevitably reduce our inclination to try a new strategy
because of our natural belief that success was due to our skill instead of luck. That makes it
more likely that random successes will be elevated to the status of perfect execution and
repeated failures will be rationalized as poor execution. Unfortunately, the randomness of the
reward we get from a lucky prediction causes us to try ever harder to reproduce it. Studies
show the humble pigeon will quickly learn the pattern required to peck a lever to release food
[3]. And if no food ever arrives, they will quickly give up. But if the reward is random, if there’s
no discernible pattern to when pecking the lever releases food, then the pigeons soon are
driven into a superstitious frenzy of pecking in trying to determine the pattern. This behavior
doesn’t seem terribly dissimilar from repeated attempts to make our predictions come true.

The Charismatic
Add in another human bias: we like confident and charismatic people. Confident, certain, and
assertive people are promoted quickly and rise to positions where they influence companies.
From there, they orchestrate activities to show they can predict the future, formulate a plan,
and execute on it. When faced with an unknown, they have a certain answer and a plan of
action at the ready, even if the plan represents a mismatch between their confidence and their
competence. So we marshal resources under their leadership and move ahead full of
certitude. Contrast that to those who are uncertain and when asked about an unknown, shrug
their shoulders and reply, “I don’t know. Let’s do an experiment and see if we can figure it out,”
leading us to turn to the charismatic individuals instead of the cautious ones.
Overconfidence bias also comes into play. Charismatic and confident people are likely to be
imbued with a sense of superior predictive ability over their compatriots. Rationally, we might
look at the 70% failure rate of predictions and decide we’re better off avoiding them because
we stand only a 30% chance of success. Highly confident people are instead likely to take a
different view, discount years of statistics from many projects, and believe their efforts will
somehow succeed where others failed.
An anecdote: Many years ago, at the tail end of the dot-com bubble, I worked in a startup as a
software developer. We were led by a young, energetic, and charismatic CEO who exuded
confidence and certainty. At the time, we leased office space in a building that had been
shedding software tenants one after the other as each one fell like so many dominoes. There
were only a few of us left, and the nearly-empty building and parking lot had the eerie feel of a
post-apocalyptic setting. It was in this environment that our CEO called an all-hands meeting
to reassure the anxious staff that our future was promising. I recall him making an eloquent
and impassioned case, filling the room with the belief we would make it.
In the end, of course, we were no different than any other of the innumerable dot-coms that
failed in the wake of the bubble’s bursting. Indeed, our denouement arrived shortly after our
CEO’s rousing speech when we failed to receive another round of financing and joined the
exodus of the building’s tenants.
Blinkered by confidence and faith in a charismatic leader, many in the company were unable to
see what was obvious: we couldn’t survive if we weren’t profitable. This was clear in hindsight,
but beforehand it seemed reasonable to believe we were different and would succeed where
so many others recently had failed. It was an instructive lesson in maintaining a reserve of
skepticism around charisma.

Being Mistaken, Usually
“Well, we won’t make that mistake again. We even fired some people to make sure it never
recurs.” That’s probably true. We won’t make the same mistake because we’re prepared for it
on the next attempt. The problem is the first mistake was unknowable before it occurred, and
the same thing will happen again, but this time with a different set of mistakes. The set of new
mistakes, to which we will fall victim, is an inexhaustible supply because they’re always

unknowable in advance. Winston Churchill perfectly described this scenario while addressing
Parliament at the dawn of World War II. Members were concerned about repeating the
mistakes of World War I and wanted assurance they would be avoided. Churchill replied:

“I am sure that the mistakes of that time will not be repeated; we should
probably make another set of mistakes.”
We’re often mistaken and simply don’t yet know it. And being wrong and not knowing it feels
just like being right [4]. Actually, being right and being wrong are indistinguishable until the
moment we’re proven wrong. That should sound a note of caution about the inevitability of
mistakes.
There’s an expression often heard in management meetings and boardrooms: “failure is not an
option.” While this is usually intended to discourage half-hearted efforts, it excludes learning
and discovery because failure is a necessary ingredient in learning. It also suggests to admit a
mistake means to admit incompetence and possibly lose one’s job. Once this belief system is
in place and cemented by financial incentives, it can lead to the idea that failure indicates we
simply need to redouble our efforts, and we’ll succeed, even if the real lesson is we need to
change course. Under these conditions, admitting an error and changing course is a difficult
thing to do because we’re irreversibly invested in our belief system. History is filled with
examples of businesses that failed to learn and continued to feed ever greater amounts of
precious capital into failed strategies, even as those strategies drove them right off a cliff. A
moment’s reflection will disabuse us of the notion that we’re somehow immune to such folly.

Strategies That Use Learning
That’s a rundown of some of the reasons why we’re often unable to learn and continue with
strategies that fail us. But what if we can avoid these pitfalls? Are there strategies that focus on
learning? Yes, and we’ll cover those now.

A Deterministic Approach
Historically, software projects used a Waterfall model of development. Requirements were
gathered, estimates were made from the requirements, and schedules were created from the
estimates. This approach is based on a deterministic view of software projects, and that with
enough upfront data and analysis, we can make accurate predictions about cost and delivery
dates. These projects often began failing early, usually due to inadequate requirements and
inaccurate estimates. In the latter case, estimates were often faulty because they weren’t
based on statistically rigorous methods but instead gathered from methods that were little
more than guessing.
It turns out, though, a deterministic view can succeed by using calibrated statistical models
gathered from a company’s historical software projects. One common statistical method is a
Monte Carlo analysis [5] [6]. The underlying mathematics are rather complicated, but it boils

down to this: we gather a set of historical data, typically including parameters like effort and
duration. We then run scenarios thousands of times, randomly varying input parameters to
produce a probability distribution that a given amount of work will be completed in a given
amount of time. For example, we might derive a distribution indicating a certain amount of staff
effort has a 25% probability of being completed within a month, a 50% probability within two
months, and a 90% probability within five months. The key point is we use historical data,
unique to our organization, to calibrate our model and produce probability ranges for outcomes
instead of single-point values. Notice how rigorous this approach is compared to someone’s
unsubstantiated claim, “I can do that in a week.”
With this approach, we’re also choosing to learn. We gather data over time and use it
iteratively to teach us about our organization’s capabilities and the cost and time required to
perform work. Of course, our model is only as good as the data we use to calibrate it. Vague
requirements specifications, poor record-keeping for completed work, and other such
shortcomings will yield disappointing results.

A Pseudo-Deterministic Approach
A fully-deterministic approach as described above works well if requirements can be specified
in advance and are not subject to frequent revision. But this type of project is rarely seen.
What if we’re working on more typical projects with unclear goals, uncertain specifications, and
unknown market needs? Deterministic predictions under these conditions are unlikely to
succeed.
Enter Agile methods.
Agile methods take a pseudo-deterministic approach to software delivery. Born out of the
frustration with repeated failures in traditional Waterfall projects, Agile methods abandon the
belief in long-term predictions and planning. They instead focus on short-term delivery of
working software and adapting to change as it occurs. By using Agile methods, we adopt the
philosophy that requirements cannot be determined far in advance but must instead emerge
over time.
One of the more popular Agile methods is Scrum [7]. Its two-week sprint minimizes error
accumulation by shortening release cycles. We reprioritize with every sprint, and in so doing
effectively reset our project clock, giving us the flexibility to adapt to change.
We can still use Monte Carlo-type methods to predict the volume of stories we can produce
[6], but we surrender our belief in one aspect of determinism: that we can generate long-term
plans determining project schedules. Instead, we once again focus on learning by iteratively
discovering what we need to deliver.
But have we actually solved the problem of predictions and plans? Or have we just lessened
the impact of being wrong about them? It seems we might still carry with us the same problem
but on a smaller scale.

An Evolutionary Approach
Accepting Uncertainty: The Problem of Predictions in Software Engineering | by J. Meadows | Medium

10

We have progressed from the long-term release cycles of traditional methods to the much
shorter cycles of Agile methods. We also abandoned the belief in long-term, fixed
requirements and chose instead to focus on smaller stories. Both of these changes help us
iteratively discover requirements and produce better results. This leads to an obvious question:
if a little discovery is a good thing, is more discovery an even better thing?
Enter hypothesis testing.
Hypothesis testing (also called Hypothesis-Driven Development) takes its cues from the
greatest experimental laboratory ever devised: evolution. Evolution makes no pretense at
being able to predict what the future holds. It simply responds to change by constant
experimentation. An experiment producing a better outcome is rewarded with longevity. A
worse outcome is quickly subjected to an ignominious end. If we’re willing to surrender our
predictive beliefs, then evolution has a lot to teach us.
With hypothesis testing, we take a slightly more deliberate approach than the pure
randomness of evolution. We proceed as scientists do when faced with the unknown:
formulate a hypothesis and subject it to measurement and failure in the real world. If it’s
falsifiable and can’t be proven false, at least not yet, then it has merit.
There are many ways to implement hypothesis testing [8] [9] [10], but here’s a simple example.
We formulate a hypothesis such as, “We believe our customers want a left-handed widget
feature on our data portal. We declare our hypothesis to be true if traffic to our portal increases
by 5% in one week.” If our hypothesis is correct, then we should see at least a 5% bump in
traffic within a week. If not, we were wrong and reject our hypothesis and possibly remove the
feature. We then reformulate our hypothesis or move on to another one. It’s beyond the scope
of this article to provide a detailed how-to of hypothesis testing, but the references provide
links to articles with instructive examples and best-practices.
With hypothesis testing, we surrender our predictive beliefs envisioning how the future will
unfold. Instead, we build incrementally, testing each small piece as we go, minimizing the risk
to capital, and cutting losses early. In effect, we make ourselves intellectually humble and
admit we have little knowledge of the future. We accept we don’t know what we don’t know
and are unlikely to ever really know much in advance. We can only discover it through
experimentation.
Most importantly, hypothesis testing minimizes the biases described above that slow our
learning. With it, we get paid to learn and use objective data to validate or falsify our ideas. We
minimize sunk costs, thereby making it less likely to cling to a failed idea. We use randomness
to help us learn instead of fooling us into seeking a reward where none is to be found.
Charismatic personalities have less sway when objective data is the measuring tool. And
finally, being wrong is accepted as the normal state and part of the experiment. In short, we’re
using an evidence-based decision system over one based on omnipotence and superstition.
We can further inoculate ourselves against bias by placing strict, consistent limits on the
amount of capital allocated to hypotheses and requiring short time-frames for proving them
true. Otherwise, we’re right back to endeavors needing “just a little more time” or “just a little

more money” to be proven right. Evolution allows no such exemptions. Ultimately, we need to
decide if we want to be “right” or make money. We sometimes seek the former while claiming
to seek the latter.
There’s one further bias to address. Humans are first, and foremost, confirmation-bias
machines. If we’re compensated for producing successful ideas, then we inevitably will seek
only confirmatory evidence for our hypotheses. We reduce this effect when, in the manner of
scientists, we deliberately seek evidence to refute our hypotheses. In short, it’s easy to find
confirming evidence for a given hypothesis, but it’s much harder to argue for its validity when
we have evidence contradicting it.
Admittedly, hypothesis testing doesn’t yield a particularly motivating rally cry like the predictive
approach’s “Full speed ahead!” By contrast, “Let’s run an experiment” is hardly as energizing.
But it has the potential to be more profitable.

A Common And Misguided Strategy
“The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves…”
Julius Caesar (Act 1, Scene 2)
Perhaps we have a biased sample set in our industry and hear only the stories of predictive
planning nightmares and not the successes, making us believe the nightmare scenario is the
common one. But given so many stories, from so many people, over so many years, it seems
the scenario is probably representative of many work environments. It contains the worst
possible choices and almost always leads to failed outcomes.
Here’s how it occurs: We have a generic, somewhat vague goal like “increase revenue from
our website by ten percent next year.” Or maybe it’s more specific like “add a left-handed
widget to our data portal because customers will buy it.” Whatever it is, it typically isn’t wellspecified, and the assumptions underlying the premise are just that: assumptions. And hidden
details will surely appear as we begin work. We’ve done similar features in the past but,
crucially, we’ve never done exactly the same thing before. But that should be “good enough”
for the basis of our prediction. We then have a developer provide a prediction that’s little more
than an off-the-cuff guess. And then we’re off to the races. It often goes like this in predictive
environments:
Manager: “How long will it take to write the Widget feature?”
Programmer: “I don’t know, maybe a month.”
Manager: “What? That’s ridiculous! There’s no way it will take that long!”
Programmer: “Well, OK, I can probably do it in a week.”
Manager: “That’s more like it. I’ll put it in the schedule. Do it next week.”
In an Agile environment, it might look like this:

Accepting Uncertainty: The Problem of Predictions in Software Engineering | by J. Meadows | Medium

12

Manager: “How many story points are you estimating for the Widget story?”
Programmer: “I don’t know, maybe it’s a thirteen.”
Manager: “What? That’s ridiculous! There’s no way it’s that big!”
Programmer: “Well, OK, it’s probably a three.”
Manager: “That’s more like it. I’ll update the backlog. Do it in the next sprint.”
This is little more than random guessing under extreme duress and creates the worst possible
conditions: vague specifications, no rigorous collection of historical data upon which to draw
for a careful, statistical analysis, off-the-cuff guesses from one programmer, and turning the
guess into a commitment to deliver according to a schedule. To this mix, add incentives for
managers to “hold developers accountable” for failing to deliver what they never realized was a
promise instead of a guess, and the understandable fear of punishment for being wrong about
their guess once it becomes a commitment. Is it any wonder failure is an inevitable outcome?
The only way it’s delivered is by cutting features, heroic overtime, and sacrificing quality. And
yet, the lesson is rarely “this isn’t working so we need to try something else.” Instead, it’s often,
“we need to get better at predictions.”
We get what we pay for. If we’re required to use predictions to derive plans, then we must
invest the time and money to do it right. If we use Agile methods, the delivery of working
software must take precedence over predictions. To do otherwise is wishing to get something
for nothing. As the Second Law of Thermodynamics makes clear, “There’s no free lunch.”

Know Thine Environment
It’s imperative to know the environment in which our businesses are operating. If we work on
large, contract-driven projects where timelines are extended and the specifications are welldefined in advance, then quantitative prediction is usually a required skill to survive. On the
other hand, if we operate in a more common environment where specifications are vague or
non-existent, the market needs are unclear or unknowable, timelines are short and urgent, and
competition for market share is fierce, then we should consider a hypothesis-driven approach.
A key problem is we often misunderstand the mathematical underpinnings of our environment.
We often believe we operate in a deterministic world where more effort will reward us with a
successful result. In fact, often we’re operating in a non-deterministic, highly empirical world
with an unstable foundation changing with time. Statisticians call this a problem with “a nonstationary base” where the mathematical foundation is not stable, and there’s no base upon
which to anchor our assumptions. Under these conditions, fixed, deterministic methods will not
succeed outside of sheer, random luck. For all of the biases listed above, it’s nearly irresistible
to believe we can predict and plan even when we can’t.
Unfortunately, if we’re not operating under stable conditions, then greater effort put into a
prediction has a higher chance of increasing our confidence in its accuracy than it does in
improving the accuracy itself. We then become certain of our wisdom, making us prone to
commit ever more capital to prove we’re right, instead of cautiously guarding our resources
and applying them when the data tell us we’re on the right path.

Accepting Uncertainty: The Problem of Predictions in Software Engineering | by J. Meadows | Medium

Knowing the environment in which we operate means pay incentives are aligned with methods
producing successful outcomes for that environment. We’re incentivized to learn, in whatever
form it may take for our environment.

Final Thoughts
One of the key difficulties with predictions lies in our natural human reluctance to accept
uncertainty. Being in a state of uncertainty and doubt is extremely uncomfortable. So we’re
much more inclined to embrace those who are full of confidence than we are those who shrug
and prefer to run an experiment to verify a hypothesis.
The external reality is this: the business environment is often governed by uncertainty,
unknowable unknowns, and darkness we must navigate with only the faintest of lights. Our
challenge is to accept the disquieting nature of that environment instead of clinging to the
comfort of a belief system that provides us with a reassuring but misleading picture.
The road to knowledge is paved with the acceptance of uncertainty. If we can learn to live with
its discomfort, then we open the path to learning. To paraphrase a famous saying: The price of
learning is eternal unease.

Good developers are defined by the quality of their codes. In the software industry,
writing good code means saving the money that may be invested in testing,
updating, extending or fixing bugs. In this article, I will show you real-life examples of
some techniques and ideas that will help you to clean up your legacy code and
refactor it to make it more robust and modular. These techniques will not only help
you to refactor your old code but will give you great ideas as to how to write clean
code from now on.

What Is refactoring and why do we need
It?
Refactoring refers to techniques and steps that help you to write clean code. This is
important for other developers, who then will be able to read, extend and reuse the
code without the need to edit much.
The next lines will show you some examples of refactoring a legacy code and make
it better.

Never refactor a production code that does
not have unit tests
My first advice is to not ever start refactoring a legacy code, which does not have
proper unit tests. I guess the reason is obvious: You will end up with broken
functionalities that are difficult to fix because you won’t be able to figure what’s
broken. Therefore, if you need to refactor it, start with testing it first. Make sure the
part you are going to refactor is covered by the tests. Check PHPUnit code coverage
analysis.

Start refactoring from the deepest point of
your code
Take a look at the next picture. This is a real project for a hotel management system
that I found on Github. This is a real open source project so the closed source can
be worst.
example: refactoring deepest points first

As you can see in this method, there are three levels marked in red. The deepest
point should be the nested if/else statement inside the first if condition. Usually, the
deepest point is focusing on a single logic which makes it easier to refactor.

Make your methods shorter by dividing
them into smaller methods or
configuration files/DB table
Maybe, in this case, we can extract it to a private method as following:
make your functions shorter

The next deepest point will be fetching the post data and loading the views. Now,
take a look at the method add() after refactoring the other parts. It is much cleaner,
readable and testable.
example: refactoring deepest points first

Always use {} within if-statements
Most of the programming languages support one line if-statements and some
developers use it because it is simple, however, it is not readable and it’s easy to
cause problems since only one empty line can break the condition and start
crashing. See the difference between the two examples:

example: use curly braces

Do not use magic numbers or magic
strings:
In the next example, you notice if rooms are more than 250, it returns an error
message. In this case, 250 is considered as a magic number. If you’re not the
developer who wrote it, it will be hard to figure out what it represents.
example: magic numbers

In order to refactor this method, we can figure out that 250 is the maximum number
of rooms. Therefore, instead of hardcoding it, we can extract it to variable
$maxAvailableRooms. Now, it is more understandable to other developers.
example: fix magic numbers

Do not use else-statements if you do not
need to:
In the same function availablerooms() you notice the if-statement, in which we can
easily get rid of the else part and the logic will still be the same.
example: ignore else statement

Use meaningful names for your methods,
variables and tests
In the following example, you can see that there are two methods from the hotel
management system called “index() and room_m()”. For me, I cannot determine
what their purposes are. I think it would be easier to understand if their names were
descriptive.
example: bad methods names

Use the maximum capabilities of your
programing language
Many developers do not use the full capabilities of the programming language they
use. Many of these features can save you a lot of effort and make your code more
robust. Take a look at the next examples and notice how it can be easy to achieve
the same result with less code by just using the type hinting.

I would like to end with a few more quick tips on better coding:
Use a new array form instead of the old one array().
Use === operator instead of == unless it is important to not check for the
dataType.
It is always a good idea to give public methods short descriptive names. It is ok
for private methods to have longer names as they have a limited scope.
Only use general names with methods that implement interfaces example add()
and use descriptive names for single classes methods addUser() or
addDocument().
Remove unused methods from your classes.
Use prefix is/has with functions that return boolean ex: isAdmin($user),

I’ve had the pleasure of managing and growing developers for a few years. Most
new developers do not suffer from a lack of skill but instead a lack of perspective.
This is true both on the structure of code but also on the structure of careers.

What to do those first few years.
Most people fresh out of school are going to end up at either a product company or a
consulting firm. Think carefully going anywhere else. The consulting route has the
benefit of seeing many projects over a short period of time. A product company has
the benefit of watching a single product evolve and the stresses that come with it.
Both experiences are valuable. However, the career options tend to be better for the
person working in consulting.
Why? Because consultants are rarely hired for out of date skills. As expensive “hired
guns”, they are hired to take on high-value projects that the company can’t staff
internally. The internal staff is often stuck with thankless maintainance of the code
produced by the consultants — regardless of quality.
Which looks better on a resume:

Part of key team writing java code to ship {major project X}, on
time and on budget
or:

Wrote code in java fixing bugs for company {major product X}.
The first one looks way better. A few years at a consulting firm and you’ll have
multiple projects under your belt. That means you get multiple lines on your resume
and multiple things to talk about in interviews. The maintenance developer has no
such benefit. As a junior developer, maintaining code is a very likely first job but it’s
not great for careers. When you are the maintenance team, you are seen as a pure
expense by management so they hate paying you. Moreover, the lessons learned
from maintenance simply don’t mean as much. There’s also the chance
management decides to toss the legacy codebase — and the team with it. Naturally,
this advice all depends on the company. Working on a product or doing maintenance
for Facebook will do wonders for your career but that’s simply not going to happen
for everyone.
The lesson: Avoid becoming a maintenance dev for your first few jobs, if you can.
Being at a product company is ok, as long as you are part of a team that makes new
things to sell.
Once you are farther along in your career a product company is a great choice. Your
existing experience will prepare you for higher responsibility and growing a product
over time provides a new and very valuable perspective.
The economy right now is very strong. If you have the skills and the choice, take a
job that will expose you to multiple projects, multiple managers, and multiple
industries as fast as possible. That’s at one of the consulting firms or an agency.
As a double bonus, the consulting world will also grow your network extremely
quickly. Since most jobs are gotten through connections, the advantage here should
be obvious.

Understanding the corporate world

Politics suck, but you need to learn anyway
The other advantage of working at consulting firm is the politics. You may recoil in
horror but hear me out. You know that phrase “Nothing is certain in life except death
and taxes”? Add politics to the list. Like it or not, no matter where you go there will
be some level of company politics. At a consulting firm, you’ll get exposed to the
politics of your own company as well as others. You don’t have to like it, but you do
need to learn it. In fact, the more you hate politics the more important that you are
good at it, because that’s how you avoid the bullshit.
Plus, those firms tend to be performance oriented. If you are good at what you do,
that goes a lot farther in a firm where your work (and billing) goes directly to the
bottom line.
It’s a balance. In my experience, the less political the workplace the better it is
because people are genuine teammates. But you won’t always have that luxury. Try
and make lemons into lemonade by learning what you can about those
environments and then find somewhere better.

Understand your industry
Software exists to solve business problems. Computer science students get exposed
to algorithms and complexity analysis and then get jobs where that stuff doesn’t

come up. In most languages, things like red-black trees and so on are already
implemented behind the scenes. What really matters is that software gets shipped
quickly and works ok. And since most software is a bunch of libraries talking to a
bunch of services, you’ll be working at a much higher level of abstraction. Should
you still master data-structures? Yes. But that won’t be enough.
So if it’s not low-level implementation that matters, what does? Solving problems.
And to solve a problem well, you need to understand why it exists and for whom.
That means understanding the business.
Thus, one of the easiest ways to make a difference and shine as a developer is to
know your industry and know your customers. I’ve seen so many developers stand
out like this, but it’s almost impossible to stand out just for code alone. Possible —
but it happens about 1/10th as often.
Learning customer service, understanding the business, and making your life easy
for your boss(es) is how to stand out. And your “boss” in practical terms is likely a
project manager, product owner, business unit director, or lead developer. Three out
of four of those will never look at your code. Half the time the lead may not either
and just trust that to someone else. But all of them are obsessed about the product
and the customer.

Interviews
Software development interviews are broken. Interviewing fads come and go, and
none of the fads has any effect at all on finding the good people. In part, this is
because companies don’t really have a common definition of “good”. And if the
company doesn’t know who will succeed there, you better believe the interviewer
doesn’t either.

Here’s what usually happens: the team is told by HR that someone is coming in for
an interview. One of the developers gets tasked to “interview the new person”. They
remember how they were interviewed, google “developer interview questions”, and
then write a bunch down 10 minutes before you show up. Whatever they saw on
Google: that’s your interview, plus a few specific questions about your past history.
These tactics are spectacularly ineffective. At best they know that you can’t be too
terrible because you did something on command on a white board. Or perhaps you
re-implemented a well known algorithm by hand, even though that’s never what
you’ll do in the job and if you did it would be a terrible idea.

How the hiring decision really gets made
At most companies, about 80% of the choice to hire or not comes down to
personality and only maybe 20% on how good at code you are. A lot of times people
will get interviewed and the company’s official response is that they really want
“someone with a lot more experience at X”. When this happens, it’s usually a
personality thing. If they just totally loved you the response would be “Well, they
don’t know X but they seem REALLY smart and they did Y which is similar, they will
be fine”.

If you don’t get a job offer and you felt you did ok at the tech — it’s a personality
thing. Charisma matters most.
You might think this is irrational, but it’s not. Once hired, you’d be spending 40+
hours a week with that team. Everyone prefers to go to work with people they like
every day. Hiring you isn’t just gaining work capacity, it’s also taking on forced
socialization with someone they just met. So work on your code, but also work on
your people skills.

Feedback and documentation
Every month, document your successes. If you increased unit test coverage —
document. If you were in a meeting with senior management — document. If you
took on a new project, document. You want this when reviews come around and also
for your own resume when it comes time to move on.
Every 3 months, proactively get feedback from co-workers and anyone who interacts
with you regularly. Take what they say to heart. Most companies have terrible
feedback cycles that will not help you. Typically, feedback is handled with about as
much planning and thought as interviews. Your boss thinks about you for maybe an
hour, grumpily writes a bunch of stuff into whatever HR system the company has
purchased, hits save and sighs with relief. It’s the rare company and manager that
really obsesses about growing their people. You’ll know you have one when you get
constructive feedback regularly without the enforcement of the HR bot.

Conclusion
If you are a newly minted graduate or early in your career, you want to look for
positions that maximize your learning not just about code, but about people.
Relationships determine success at least as much as code ability unless you are a
truly 1/10,000 developer — in which case start your own company.
When you are going into an interview, realize that you’ll likely be asked to
whiteboard, write out algorithms, or any number of other hoops. These will probably
have no relation to your actual job, but you need to do them anyway. But the real key
is to be personable. Liking you as a person will go farther in a quick interview than
liking your code. But if you don’t get the job, realize that it’s quite possibly nothing to
do with you.
Keep going. One day, you won’t be a junior developer any more.
